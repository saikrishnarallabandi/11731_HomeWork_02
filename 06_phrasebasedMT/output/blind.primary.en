yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
thanks very much . thanks for the invitation pops up here today , to talk .
and i have to me , yes , which i imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to an term , <unk> the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one them , second largest organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city , accountable .
and yes , so you do , not quite popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something about my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
it means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is obviously a subject matter , i do you today <unk> want .
which , and the topic <unk> , because this is also heard the firemen .
we hope for the best and it for us on the worst of that has jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't , so serious enough to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we talk , if it 's a risk is that we briefly , a stand , for <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are the way .
it being , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any time .

leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people scream out .
these <unk> .
, get out .
what 's because this ? to ask passersby .
that we know , not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
children and cry .
some of falling , and perhaps , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who failed .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic is breaking out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i <unk> . <unk> ?

there 's such a suitcase can be some of them .
afterwards she turned out , that only , in <unk> , nine thousand pounds of drugs that were .
but the people were just like , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building , forced into .
it was n't told .
and it was that same kind who of at least in the group on , my friend , my friend , i found myself .
god is `` thank you is n't panic that have , otherwise would be the whole thing that we are not so safe to run out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is kind of a very important thing .
communication is that matters because the people in this situation is literally after the communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's because it .
it used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> there .
you , this fair to say , the people get in panic , there 's say , we would n't like the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time , she and public television is not more possible .
just and really , therefore , because it 's one is not an is , and secondly , mostly are doing anyway , we the past when the agency , over the event to report .
you remember , may still , the one in the hudson river , in which is a year , here .
the reporting that came at twitter .

that was no <unk> .

because most of course , we 're also the last , supposedly , the truth will know , because we as n't we need to course , to notice that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either ca n't pay so we thought , or they do it also not .
of , we 're going in the food , and that 's also something that , even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and that we 're going to the good old raid , back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
it means that we 're going to the next few years about a hundred raid , in the <unk> build that , some of you know that , <unk> , if it 's going to <unk> coming .
once it was so .
you may be you know , what does three in short , even mention briefly , once a long and even just means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the world today is the human beings with all <unk> , we , to have , so <unk> , facebook , twitter , over the radio <unk> also at night , over the television and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> to pick up the information on to get .

and we ultimately , not anymore , that to believe what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one in a question of the rapidity of all media , to stand , and it 's also a question of its credibility .
the credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion time again , is it 's not , or they say , <unk> us , it 's all very much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore , good experience to be done with facebook and twitter , in .
also that you may have some of in them on the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and that one thing called the chemical bomb .

the only problem is , many of these hydrogen bombs -- i 've never works and are , like , in <unk> under one in the food <unk> .
and there were we go from one elderly gentleman , be some extent , he so beautiful in the turnaround , to wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> forty-three like it 's and now <unk> 's the authorities , it informed that 's a bomb . laughter throughout the background .
the way since i have to acquire multiple older , the cases in the whole <unk> .
we 're going to see what we still find everything .
these hydrogen bombs to immediately shifts of place , not have defused , but in fact that .
and so we 've then in <unk> park , which simply and really , one , in every sense the word , a bomb , exploding .
and the first time in the history of the city around the communications , facebook and twitter , let it run with the consequence of the <unk> far over <unk> <unk> total , followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with those of telephony , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
that all had a great effect for us , because the credibility that 's clear , increase over these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign that there , when i stop to .
i can go from this is not going to the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media for the advantage we have to you very much information to pass .
it 's not very <unk> are , because the members of the there are continuing , or the <unk> , they called , a high <unk> .
secondly , fast we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that anyone responded immediately , so the credibility that , i just talked to have to clear up , because of the entire community in principle , the reports that involved .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , it 's very fast as you correct .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> the fun to find indeed , as a bomb , in <unk> park , about .
of so we 've come from all the things that the last few years , what are , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense encounter a still think , as intense encounter a third .
also the city to eat it every day of such a jar of looking to be .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but they can also , and also then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i am , we see there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , think munich , think of other cities , if the then in fact to , because you just something called a <unk> , the you have conventional or not to defuse that can , then we know already , to be a variety of houses , not more that look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> which is necessary , communication to do anything to leave you also turns out to stop to give to worry about to carry that the people of these are to give to worry about to carry that the people in the are able to , these difficult situation , to .

of so now is <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross et etc. , but about communication in the catastrophe and with a catastrophe about us all .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and over facebook , a lot of the aid did , if we also partially destroys you still so overwhelmed with was , because suddenly <unk> of people to any <unk> build wanted , and you know , does n't even more , where the <unk> .
this is also , there 's still a lot to do , indeed , the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented amount of solidarity with the <unk> and the redeveloping dying , just showed that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think about .
and i hope that i do you a little bit more convinced of you have to this media , that yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , in <unk> its meaning and purpose it , and that we as a city , the flight , <unk> of this is , this instrument , in the future , and then , new , and very different from the transportation that are going to her , to the citizens to use the zones , and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , when i do you have the time , barely seen this .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , like you just have heard .
and i 'm now , they also , the one of your own <unk> to reasons .
what it is , there <unk> they 'll , that i 'll ask you also a few years ago .
before i do that , i must but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we stories that you want to live longer need .
that we no stories that i could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment business actually produced .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite series of africa , of fact that well as anybody <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and fourth , i 'm <unk> of that people that were created , to be creative .
and that they have are , once you 'll be creative people can .
ever more people are happy , the better , it 's about the world .
thanks very obvious .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to start to midnight poised in a <unk> , in the just happy <unk> it will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now , they give you of the first disposition and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , it strikes midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and they did n't really word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i 've all the word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the one side <unk> and do in <unk> and everything is pretty stark white .
i 've got madd '' feeling that i 'm somehow felt pretty <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other , we 've got the two , then in oz -- with very very much color .
and it was , in , once told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when that i 'm drawing .
so the first of , what <unk> now with their new perceptions begin to see , is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her admission is , you very seriously at , and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> it <unk> about it on that you to a very special kind of people heard .
she was as <unk> born .
are people , from your <unk> have to her lifetime to be .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very good .
so , imagine the <unk> it <unk> n't swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cubes , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is the players have no insight on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not when we 're going to die .
i wish , in a long life , but we know it was n't .
it can also the morning , everything , over .
and so it 's in my players , so .
you know , do not to evaluate how much you because actually can play .
that , and again , every lost full minute that the last been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime them , <unk> , the <unk> as a candle that <unk> will .
now you can , of questions : if that because this is dangerous , why games , then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player does , he 's actually alive .
the were to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world of players <unk> , your first challenge is , of course , inevitably , <unk> love , is the story that i tell you want .
and that story in a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens , i just to be late seen this .
so , 12 , in the first season , with a total length of each spent five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told that you know .
that television , for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , if only ' i now , first job done .
and what does not here .
now let 's but , we 're off .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most set of the movie or from the series ?
it can now , there , right .
thanks .
as if we practiced that have .
and that is slapping on my players , which is not to .
of which is it , very many , there .
there 's so many different games .
it you just have to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so that are right here 's a lot of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is because it all share ?
i ' , a pretty hard of opinion of me .
i think give me for sufficient smart and to be creative .
but i know that 's a hundred brain , producing as just one , it 's mine .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of pulling in .
what would , if we <unk> not just nonsense , or to allow us , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , the development of this <unk> with the thing .
so , imagine for instance , in the result , three diving into a <unk> on , they really neat to find , because it for example , her grandfather , it .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the modern technology is that yes , i did n't even more so hard to a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it , right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience down this is .
that is , it 's not anywhere , , but it goes on the right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet , yes , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind of the light .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , turn , what that they do want .
and if we now , again this structure through .
that looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of the internet was born to pick exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it just doing , unfortunately , not so many , or at : no one .
so , now go , i but even still a step further and making the audience was have to the player .
because in a <unk> .
there , against the characters from the series of meeting , against people in the real specific environment , as these <unk> on your phone .
deduce the news here , you may also all very well , are something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas , just very rapidly developing .
and the i do n't you can , because i else again , 20 minutes i 'd need .
we take root again .
everybody 's time off of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of the moment , i have to this is about to detect , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> there .
and i 'm going to say , these jury was all of legislators of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you want to my .
and when i the to convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use the narrative structures to revolutionize the way , still better world , i think , i can actually every convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is the whole , that ?
because they had been alone in the names all areas that covered up .
we have of course , first of the <unk> , who is it , i 'm running , you 're running , everybody 's time .
now , then that die .
in the series of it 's very much .
everybody 's time it means : everyone needs to time to die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time running in terms of everyone can be part , if it do want .
this is i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse , in my opinion , as if it looks as a <unk> will .
i do n't know that they 've seen that .
if you in the theater , are and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please , not me .
and that 's not what it 's .
so it 's volunteer at .
and nobody has to .
he can also just the viewer can be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the to the project , the german , will be the first place .
that has also a few reasons .

that i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some small niche move .
and i really actually really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people to be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the bottom and then everybody <unk> and every off <unk> been reclassified .

and if you now you ask , why i 'm here at a <unk> , where it , but the headline <unk> worth , <unk> .
that i also a couple of the time .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also quite on the amount of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .

but it uses , it 's nothing , you let 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just , all taken of have , what i mean , i 've learned .
and it applied this .
and yet it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if you now , anybody thinks , i want to have been my part that , i had 19 degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i , ai drawing <unk> cartoon , or what that , that 's also have already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
it , as freely in the speaker .

welcome to , you can memories are ?
question , you .
you can memories are ?
you can you , because , all remember , in your life ever 's happened ?
they 've still <unk> that ?
who has who can , all remind you ?
it go to do n't .
so you have memories are ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want that 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , pretty quickly .
another good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today , tonight , i 've chosen , because he two of my passions , or my two great love down at connecting .
i ' , here in the near the computer science , studied and i did , let me just with the bits and of bytes of busy , today , so large prints through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and who was in private and professional capacity in the way .
the one side and i so with the `` well , very much too , the other , i 'm now it in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that this the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to a comparison these two .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about an artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can say to , when we can build a computer , that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we already quite close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that .
but let me tell you time i do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> little kid needs .
so the comparison directly between the computer on the one side and our brain on the other .
if we the computer taking , then based , everything , so your smart , you a tablet , you <unk> and also these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .


the word has fundamentally determines , everybody gets heard and in <unk> it will always so as a triangle , and the arts .
that <unk> little device that has three ports , and forth accordingly electricity , or not .
in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' work extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of little parts .
and the turn up to do n't get mess .
we can store , things , we we can calculate the things , we had 19 degrees ' you with albert einstein 's say , listen , 'n computer can do anything you can be very much , very quickly , but actually , he can just zero and one of compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite made me .
we want that 's time you compare with our brain .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of up here in there .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 , 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is to a higher than that , what we now , when computers .


and the is , and this is , the equivalent of two big selling bananas , so more you do n't and her , she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant good calculator with <unk> , why we use the then not , why we remember that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the human nature uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy you 're now this <unk> to <unk> brain .
and <unk> because they 're wrong , the commercials have a bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution to this one of the pups , that was yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , anything other , <unk> educated .
this is not to happen because we do n't that we use .
why it seems to then that we the largest piece of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the term of the pun here ?
the i compared , the , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , see , in the ocean , is the top so the top , then there 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .

we <unk> the point of that we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and to time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , suddenly , much more detail it can remember when i do n't seen . i ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you then <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that goes , there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , okay , so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , he got up , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome effectively went , which , rome to view , so rome that is yes , now . ow , not necessarily the city , which , after a giant planetarium , signs of myself on and has started to rome to draw .
and that 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once seen it , he <unk> , it could go back to paper into .
where is approaching now that ?
so why ca the terrain , why we ca n't do that , well , he 's also be a very close to the <unk> bit more access to , nine-tenths of the craft .
now we use the yes , but why i can now , not , to the <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to some of those experiences .
he has even the example , you 've been working and has done with a rape survivor who worked , had her experience is completely eliminated , this was n't even more mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , that 's not happening , that is the way .
it , it was the very well , right .
now went , but it , and <unk> .

and actually is with this hallmark of the state 's go .
the second what i , it was , was , he has a lady in <unk> suppose that has told me to her mother always embarrass her to alice in wonderland , and i read , when they 're small was , four years .
there was you , which your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he has her , in a trance , goes , ago .
then she have begun to read , she was four days when they have that is , they could then still do n't read , today can look at this .
and then you have said , he said , i tell me , <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland , they found , where that on this side of the lyrics which said , the lady , and i read .
the brain , so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
then we could you read .
so , we 've actually retained access , but we seem to because the normal life , we <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .

and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> bit above and , you can i ask you to conclude , they just a very quickly affects your eyes .
and you remember , a very 're , one incident in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get maybe a picture , a movie ?
some of the time not only on , because we 've felt that normally do , but that they make it 's the first time of a lot .
and if you see that , it be you to either in the movie , are , from their eyes , all experience , like , see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they 're allowed the final thought back to solve , we get to the eyes peering back up .
who has because a visual information to get the time hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third , i would say , that 's about that , what i expected of have , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's going to us in the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what we also is beautiful , , memories , if you have memories <unk> , is yes , not just that memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that , we <unk> a positive that event and i , the one or else 's smiling can see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there were , they laugh , and already is the memory may still there , in fact that we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what 's exciting .
<unk> everything that was my , well , the our brain power , the spot , no difference between what we actually remember , and because of what we just imagine , what we could color .
also that you can try out , if you , <unk> down , something in the future to discuss that 's still not happening is , they 're similar information to do something , if the opportunity to remember , what the past .
and , , you know , but there are these stories that you , so , in social situation round , of time .
then , hey , there is that happens , and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for these stories behind , more beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people still a sober , there was the evening , a lot situation , there was the sunset it , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in retrospect , do , so if we actually our memories that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask you ?
<unk> , when i came down here , has told me my uncle is a picture that , of his hut and in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very shack .
just , this picture is nothin ' <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic depiction of freedom , he told me explain , well , there 's the shack <unk> bit around , there is nothin ' 'n bit more of grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog that there , which is the sun at the alps , that 's quite a picture of the shack , not going to make .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own external memories , hey , what it bothers me , because , i guess that still more fun doing , what i there is think ?
they 've actually make a freedom , in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people , you see the morning , if you just like this can have eyes , what 's because this ?
yes , i ' `` bad , you 've made , i went around the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me not anymore .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he , germany was , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he has you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night with the son , down , and has said , has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , use in the time , and then he has led him to make it , it <unk> let , it just tell the what is good happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son was doing .
and then it was also okay , that -- way is that comes , back to visit .
and the is today , that , the youth , done with the , is one of <unk> people that i know .
it , so they are not the memories , influence , , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we want on around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that was today , now . ow , that 's so , <unk> this centuries-old practice , but i really does n't , they make it 's , like , you might tom cruise walk in this <unk> into the film he has this , that these <unk> computer , where he shares his files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , they looking for her image that <unk> have of this , well , not very much like . one of a have to tell you , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , can , way to .
what ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , this is a , look over time , <unk> , that has told me <unk> ' real , like , man , that was that was beautiful , all right ?
and then they take that , with .
they take that , in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you know somebody <unk> 've got to <unk> , that it <unk> their their boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , take you also this image that , put you <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , you make the background of horses jump , they laugh , why people laugh , you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so , ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity to think it all that can .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we make an event , a memory , one of them , it comes on us .
my plea to you , you , you play with the images in your mind , they use the power of their own unconscious and they give him every day <unk> , their lives , enrich themselves .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i on a party ever asked me , what i 'm so in my spare time doing art and tell that i got together with friends , <unk> <unk> and up , i see is shining eyes and in the head of my audience around the <unk> of those dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> come up .
if i then <unk> that it , the film festival , to a film festival , classical music is , say , of those dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank zappa once said , about music to talk about it 's something like about architecture to dance .
and so much more importantly , that with the what we do .
so they still a glimpse of getting this , which i 'll talk , i put them a short film with them .
film .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that 's my view , the question is the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different .
we makers , are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle of the end of two decades old and i have very early in our youth who experienced , which an enormous power and delight us that classical music <unk> .

and we are the , of belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not to the content , so , the music , but at their <unk> is .
so we imagine the question , a <unk> create the music , the near the friends and this force over again , there , so that we pay so , you 'd like .

we imagine the parameter that you from the classic concert will know , the room , light , context , basically in the question .
we take for instance , in the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gulf .
we 're trying to the food up .
you see it 's a picture of our <unk> .
the musicians to sit in the audience , drink beer , and entertain , in the breaks down with the audience gathers to stand on to play a , two pieces , put them , again in the audience .
all this is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody , like it has <unk> , from the stage , and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in classical , concert , it 's so that you on more or less of comfortable , permanent , chairs , like you here , and to jump forward , we look and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we 've cluttered with has done , how can this will .
if you , sit and it a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , you are automatically lead differently .
still going to come out that we in the concert does n't a stage , i had , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so , sitting in night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music of thinking .
that we so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the minds of the people need the music that they so , are we can see how they are supposed to ?
and that then roll concerts by night to <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just of <unk> lit up , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can make music alive to let and now , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together , with us the dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop the really did n't want to dance has been written .
and that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve get rich .
and in this year we 've got a , that if you want to <unk> too .
we have the first time , a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has all , as well , for that works , because we have a big <unk> had , in this piece by the subject .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from , germany , back , so that we 're the embodied into the minds .
there is this film festival , what came from a community turned out of .
we 're totally happy in the near boiling of <unk> in the town <unk> a home , they found .
the city is that big that we think about spaces and exciting place for actually find , but also that small , that we 'll notice .
if the beginning of the year in two weeks forty <unk> from , europe around the city are , then drops on just to the city , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the film festival is , volunteering that organized .
we makers , are a very colorful a mixture of students and students , and doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or did , and funding in your eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> , for a year , so that you do is taking .
it , volunteering , but they care , for a year is that , for example , the <unk> or the <unk> , <unk> in , of hands are and to the film festival by going .
we do that all in our time , and live in all of germany over .
that the part of the work of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , make sure we all over the year is distributed to a different extended weekend , we make , to talk about the , or other problems that appeared soon are , and caring for this is also interpersonal together , that simple and that 's important , something that if you in motion , i think we want .
to film festival , even come then two decades until thirty thousand volunteers , the first to , a few days or a few weeks hence their hands of being and there is where the help it 's needed to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days to the musicians this .
now you could mean , so you have everything else you for this is a film festival , needs .
but our <unk> is that .
we have is in <unk> in the city a large community to us built around , well , supported in the what we want to do .

that <unk> is in a barnes in the city , over the year alberto giacometti made and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole lot of individuals who found , their living room to put up to the musicians and samples .
and this and the way that 's the film festival , something -- user-generated wisdom in this city has and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very special kind and the way with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> of support the citizens of place a <unk> to live out , now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers , from the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly deeply happy about that , europe , young musicians played music in your hand , and home . in the cities <unk> hold .
if you now we still not that really can imagine , that feels , classical music , like to experience then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may know , acquire skills .
you heard about this to learn , or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn about , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , with an experience , <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture that have , well , there , in a lot of course to say , because now . ar : am suggesting <unk> i mean , in this field .
and so i thought that it may be really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , both laughed .
you get , the laughter , though the most of the saying that you know .
that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word . if something <unk> , what we 're not that really means we can .
art , that we say , sometimes , that has what .
to work , we say that often , that has what .
sometimes as well .
the people , like to work , that has to tell me .
but at work , we think rather , <unk> and the art , rather , the rich , beyond the everyday , where we 're inside of us move , our experience to collect , our own thoughts that .
and so i 've been my life , i do you now you want , in about three hours in five to move into a split , all the headline have to , i start to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the whole childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , about and then on the word <unk> i 'm later , why i think that for my <unk> taken this .
the interaction , for the first part of my professional life and finally , five , positive identification .
intense of them is this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian 's the stream that you know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn it that the first two , three years , if you were to practice , and i -- we practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have the little pieces was playing , the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , to go home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and played and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is right , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial to the art , it succeeds , and if it only two , who are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , is , works , images , in <unk> , in your plays , things that <unk> are now , in the moment to put together , the art makes me .
and i have , and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , the <unk> <unk> , the same time to play , any kind but to hear that one to illustrate that do n't .
so that was , what i because i learned of have , under one .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i was the worry or so that it 's going to me today may also like to be .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i had it .
i brought her .
so again , the right now , and the same in , i 've got back to do n't on .
the audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them , and the third time the beginning .
and they do n't the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very immersive experience .
perhaps that was also one of experiences , where i then you know , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my spent go , because , to talk , you can be easier with cheating .

when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and told him , rather , mr. <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
because you have to create a lot of coffee who have and very much of experience with women raised up .
now imagine , you time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , like a sentence .
the i sort of course not forget .
and of , i sort of course , more adept at .
now i was the way too . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation , i mean , i 've never more experienced this .
it was that <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a 'm just do n't control , and she was with the most beautiful , in place , as you had the poor do , and then went that back together and back apart .
i could it now unfortunately , not going on play , is not a piano , here , and i could it also not anymore .
i have this job in two decades , 30 times 'd been playing and suddenly , you right .
and i then they keep playing and <unk> , i was in a feeling ecstasy and played , and i 'm not only still , that i suddenly the soil quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to finish , not taken , and the music has this with me this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also , to work that you in this had get , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like of yourself , when we the <unk> did , the only two months taken , where you usually a half years , i 'd need .
so , that were my unsighted experience with the piano , with the art , with the confluence of work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , even when musicians out , but just as <unk> .

i <unk> given and have taught me , so it , next to my <unk> for the music and engage you can , and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , breathing , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience , i was very , on , enlighten ourselves .

which is the art of culture to , to my <unk> .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not say <unk> , but rather than <unk> to move forward and on something to do .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i did , and of , i 've always more with this question about me , what you can do anything to art to the framework for art to improve to a management , a new management of building ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , on 'm in my professional lives , , this <unk> , <unk> years , i mean , then <unk> .

<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my résumé , because i in <unk> was even born , it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> to pet peeves -- when i think , i have to the kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my maternal grandparents were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the carnivale experienced .
that was i 'd rather , what i do n't like being enjoyed just have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived , of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the carnivale on us was coming , were all in a very another situation , another situation .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague who was , because we have , for the <unk> the music done , he had guitar , i piano , other has a bass -- played , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but obviously keen on text that the <unk> <unk> , for months practiced .
and this carnivale , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with the wall fell .
i was the next day , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me , fast on being prepared , on any questions , <unk> .
and go there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and it 's where i again , you know , interaction as social interactions are going on between two germans cultures .
actually speak , we the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was a wonderful played , but a lot of it was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the carnivale it was not the people all of myself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i do when a big gain and realizing , here to experience as the german , as well , that i 'll see , which time , back , slowly , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , connecting .
since is germany , <unk> .
since is also the federal much more <unk> , places .
interaction , i then , but of all things here we learned and i know , in the city of food .
we have of the first place that i had actually a <unk> , imagine if you time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the still .
and play for was <unk> , you did n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first of the <unk> .
so i play which is not so much so , was that 's wonderful , these <unk> had , but you know , soon , because i then for education in charge , and to make alliances , education do and they could .
we have very much for the urban studies done , we have the if you only time that the analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we are there is designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture of it can , from <unk> to <unk> , the blue one of stones .
many , again , we were and i could make and i experienced , and the time , what this , if different people from different areas , a target to track .
they memorize the way that i became more and <unk> of the art , more and the culture , which , the scientific unifying between humans , between cultures , between those communities , better , in the view , and i come , but afterwards the art .
at this was also then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea that had to the would be , january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> those are promoting shinerama .
but that last chapter that is a fifth one chapter one has yet the headline of identification .
this word , yes , two primary meanings , one thing , , i either me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i put it , but also as verb use and say , i either of something that means , i know something .
and that 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i either you , or the or that community .
and i either me with something , when i 'm trying to <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and this is a very big action .
five billion point three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , identify the double the sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as large , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , in a big farmland , life , but at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our key frontier of identification , to the people and of you course , too much a ride .
the signs , <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
a nice experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .

and it was already a special effect that young girl who have letter from young <unk> up and boy , the russians and then the letters of young men from germany in fact , heinrich , german .
and there sits down , one of these young men , in the piano , and he played this <unk> , i so loved .
and , oh , who he made of a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as young german , he was , and i ca n't even more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers , <unk> .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in this play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it was for him .

we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move anything , but of all things we 've learned that we sixties , in <unk> in peace of life and the culture that connects to do n't even more than the minds go , because we different languages to talk , that we have to identify , to us , inside of feeling .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you can see it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it goes to learn always been about , something to learn and <unk> .
and if we 're much , and this happen , <unk> , if we let it that we inspire and let 's kind of art and culture of our own position to relate , in a dialog with the artwork , if we interact and finally , to our own identity and tried to work , by we faced with art and culture of them , let me , we 've all made
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they are those profit .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture of ideas .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory is that 's a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , one direction to find and me with a subject of the way through , where i think that 's going to the next few years to engage .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what ted 's also means , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk about an arbitrary .
and then i still have heard that you can to talk , in english , i think we should , if somehow it possible , but , if you look at it , then , you would n't understand , what i in english to say , i was not directly , i do it to say , and so , what i talk , but the german , left .
how we will die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , i the <unk> <unk> , and was bringing down .
she was , nine-tenths of years old , and has always like in the may , dance , because they do this also , her husband who reminded , the first man , in war by it was then .
and this is , every year for the first of may be able to dance , you go and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to finish , and then is bringing down and , , here to the right , you see this , the leg gets broken , the <unk> .
a few years earlier was they also , even slowing down and i mean , the same way , with equal of occasion , and well , even the left leg gets broken .
and i was also , there as a physician and have experienced , weeks of the intensive was , with the antibiotics that was treated , resurrects itself , and have the discussion around , as i said , is because that sense ?
it does a sense , held in this old people like this very intense , it is to use to ?
so really is , to <unk> , the intensive care for weeks , like this is a people at all <unk> ?
and they then is essentially cured .
five years later i enter the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the i can , i 'll notice , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time and then , and , the dance in the may be back the other one leg gets broken .
so , the question is what <unk> i there 's actually , when i talk about , like a human for , decide what to say , what he was in his directives , or what he also , <unk> which ?
and that 's a little bit about the theme of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the director named , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report , the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization are very ahead was , so you , asking , how can , go , connected to work ?
this , then , and that you in this book is also , you read , just said , it 's a quality of coming , so the always fit .
it 's a silos of labor in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going to the example , china , but that was a big issue .
and that 's actually , so come to basically the work of the individual , so something to assemble , something to paint , less , ending , that he always more control , of the quality , it delivers of the accuracy .
and that , after my location , the people 's less and confidence from their work to draw you could and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it was never about the height of <unk> to reach , and not more about , through his work , to define .
and if we that now , the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's course , that one development .
if you the tv , to hear about the doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most of lament , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , as it 's nothing to document , what you has done , so it <unk> 's going to make it even paid to , and if not going to document is , says the health service 's also , that care or that medical treatment for we do n't .
and through this feature documentary , but the work <unk> always more <unk> and more and is approaching this idea that you his work too , and with the use of personal belief compound , the background , like a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a great friend of me is now , the netherlands , you go , because it do n't see here , they wanted to the had a <unk> practice , the up , is after the netherlands , you go to the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are at these software development comes mostly a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced that are more and old people swing between the nursing , the hospital , and back , because the <unk> not more you know , what they should do , if it 's the people , went .
then you get the hospital , the house , you 've restored to go back in my senior citizens , or a nursing , and be there on those loans .
and this family had , just thought , if it 's something that difficulties in holland , there , then i want me , like to train , let me to stand here to promote that you out of this vicious cycle of <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , in holland , which had he however , after he the language with a lot of that i 've had learned that there 's exactly the same thing happens , what transpired in <unk> happened .
it will also the dying of a quality in place .
it 's not anymore , the credibility that counts , but you put even in a freely available , i want for instance , not be , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing home .
and then they do that <unk> .

so just with the , i want to be or i do n't want to be .


and that for my friend now , there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , he lies with me to do .
in the last , it 's so that <unk> is about their sixties , seventy percent of the people not anymore , die , but in hospitals , institutions , and that these institutions that 's , so you do that as well , not the ideals of these are for the old people , but it 's often a tightly to fund , <unk> scope , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding standpoint , and for , this <unk> find there , after my sense , just limited .
there 's about it , who are the very good about , there 's very <unk> people , there are , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so roughly five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us so , then i would for me say , it is hard , there , getting along and be inside the self-esteem , unsustainable .
the entire course , has <unk> reasons , this is very clear , this whole quality , those of it 's why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough , that all humans , optimal , and in the way of those are and that people , for good , or the medical contribution are , so we 're paid you to say , there was -- i well with , because i can for instance , as caregivers have a family of feed , or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it , just below .
this introduction of the quality , one time , which market , you bring governance to work , so , the individual countries affected .
and now i 'm going to how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the last , because i mean , first of questions asked , and this , so , it 's the situation for affected .
and it 's where i just time that <unk> <unk> and the article on one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society that it would always like this structure , legal structure , which we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just that would the people 's much untouchable stars .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there , which every one , , the commission will have to the land , was going to protect and to defend themselves .
because that a way is themselves , to be free from this case , i do it 's another way , and the to me , somehow , so , and feed and then we need that i was looking at least not thinking about doing , i mean , once i 'm going to die .
because in the last , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to ask , we will eventually , the point .
hopefully will first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career , to say that wish i each and because i want , about , but some point is , this subject to face , and if it then maybe so far is , or as well , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm talking about this question now even think .
if you now think about , what does mean i 'd like , then you 're going on the results come , in the turn out , what are because actually the five most important things in my life has been ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en <unk> .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends and i mean , with that i go and exchange can , you know me and the me through the living with , it are the <unk> .
it 's quite sure that trust between humans , which i may also related to have , in <unk> or in the actual visits , or a pastor or a <unk> or you with other people , with that i put in the relationship , learn .
and it there are very many of factors of course , there <unk> , i 'm the right now , not all through .
but if you , these three penalty points , time at , then you have time of tasks , , in life there may be in that we need to the last his own was going to protect .
and then coming then , another factor that we 're going to a dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i posted this , as a text , or as well , as an example of taken .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we 'd only can of us even come out .
so it 's not the question to be because others to me to do , who 's going to me , feed , for babies , or , for me , in fact , who goes on me to be ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to be asking where i can on people want , where you can i put myself and by my inner would die of that i do with these questions that can , and i was there position and make it .
you go and then he says , how we 're going , so that inside this quality of us , put it was , it 's a way to say how i me about my my inner would , this mechanism of the day .
because no man can tell me at the way i myself , because you see , and position to .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or are say , you have to now an advance directives out and because you 've been so old , me , going to you , if you be want to see if you on a pediatric intensive want .
these questions , i can be in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this was the people 's one of posture , in me is , and the not , though they can be the state , not can protect , as a law , not , i also other people <unk> can and so i 'd rather <unk> to be when i think that there was have done with that i asked myself have to have , so the also know , what i for a person , i 'm .
and to those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and because i think , and this is because i have this talk about this is called , and here , over years , are these spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here , both to go on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these issues you think to , where a more room is , so it does n't hurt , is that 's also may not to our theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old are , it can say , oh yeah , like a dance in the may , despite my may very high ages , that would , what .
i thank you very much indeed .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm bringing two things with .
if you the first part to go , is , you think you a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
this is really dumb , not , can take .
what my you ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
that 's not good , if this one of this is , what she went down .
so , but i 'll it , for the , you know it .
and that we do n't .
we engage us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little too . '' to a finite planet .
<unk> , finite , we know , are beginning to form , we need to know .
and it 's for the <unk> the magnitude of them .
if we in a finite way are , and if you just two <unk> , in the one example , chairs , in the other people .
and we know , now , we need to look in the box in the number is small , it are three : chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking the votes in each of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
they count , how would we do it ?
that we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three we get the three , we count the chairs , at three : chairs , one , two , three three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that mean , yeah ?
very good .
this works in a finite wonderful , that works , and large numbers , though it sucks .
but it .
how do you still lost count ?
how can still going to check that so many people like the chairs out there are ?
i know , chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> let me !
that 's what you mate .
you , that this is , not , we 're now the ground on , and understand that all !
not , that 's very nice .
so , that 's what you , too much advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of you on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> the way , the next <unk> , it some shopping beforehand , different people get different , chairs , not a chair is abandoned and the amount of these are the same size , okay .
now we 're going to the infinity .
how do we have two large infinite amount of each other 's conceivable ?
we 'd say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we 'd go back to .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite speed for a lot to start to count , i 'd time just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , forever , is , <unk> ?
so how it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had but that 's really started .
they mate .
so , now , here 's what happens .
we estimate , we estimate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you cook it .
if i said , for the <unk> take the natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the next to the beginning to zero , one , two , three times four , five .
and we have , we say , a copy of this <unk> and take from a piece of the infinite , you <unk> pay off .
and there are able to the right the numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all along linear numbers are <unk> the infinite number of a long , have the numbers , but the a band n't have the <unk> , the other people are the line , and the <unk> on , okay .
we call the a lot , g , straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n have the numbers .
do you know ?
is , g and more powerful , it 's bigger than through n , the same or smaller ?
the same ?
but this is very high handling so , yes , a missing , the <unk> .
who 's a different what you go ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , has yes , really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not going to do n't support , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you also suspected of course , it 's wrong .
and now , and now i 'm explaining why the amount of the same .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two of it 's two , after the zero from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , six , three , eight , four , yeah ?
you can that 's also turn back , it 's doubling , this is , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , by the <unk> we do it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural diet on the straight , <unk> , <unk> are way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's just in the infinite .
so if you any chance to explain what we have today i learned to have an eternity go from , what 's because it , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property that 's in a finite because it 's not and this is , is an absolute <unk> , a real subset of the way that big is .
do that they in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a great , and before they let 's three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
it 's none of links ?
okay .
then do we still a second part of the odds .
the professionals , -- the odds .
i did this is what brought .
with this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , that on , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i 've got behind anything or hidden , i hope that you has a 's not heard .
and they should now we 'll just guess .
where , my you , i have something hidden , behind the a , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate the c .
who still has one another idea ?
the a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the yes , never , <unk> ?
that 's right .
it 's really different matter , so they have to do n't mean , three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance you to do it has always have been blessed , is yes , it has only at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's up .
<unk> , that , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it is , and the best guess , and appreciate that , or how do anything that you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now , the game explain what i now , now , <unk> .
so it 's , we go in a second round .
now , , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the n't it 's and the they do n't have said .
because , if you 're now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , one of out .
but i have to my , that 's <unk> , in the second round .
so i can not just an open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the -- the odds , under the sisyphic condition 's remained , under the sisyphic condition , b is open is , and it 's not one is , you have now your last chance , to guess .
they must now , a to stay , then i do necessarily a , on .
i 'm now this on , what they want .
or they say , i 'm a c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god is `` thanks to b , you have been is , i always wanted to , a to stay it does .
or would you 're now say , is , <unk> , we have to <unk> the way , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what my you ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , that 's wrong .
this seems , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have to <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i do n't know , six and yeah , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll do n't even more part , <unk> ?
so , it get really everyone .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third plant behind a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds are you in the dirt .
that would you can on two doors to guess is not something that you ca : yes , at <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , the zero , and transferred that 's yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is now , here , two thirds of it 's not , guess .
so what 's the two thirds of here , but it , just behind a door to be possible !
behind the onus is a 's not .
so , then is likely ?
no way , i am i really been hiding .
so , what is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stay , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course .
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got a little better .
why ?
very simple , two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory , and practice .
i hope that it was for every what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here , of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people coming , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i whistle , my best , that after all the way is that has some insights .
i come , which of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 signature was n't make a mcdonald 's .
that time , who , yes .
yeah .
thank you for the references some today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know that mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to be asking whether i do the ted , the seas as well i want , and over a particular topic i want to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the subject of trust .
now , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , has said , maybe the power of a or another , later , sport .
if only i also full of this .
so tonight is the rain , jogging to be now <unk> a tall order , but i need to go tomorrow , they train , because i in three weeks , the <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to want with 'm a bicycle , that are <unk> miles .
go to me is the morning , the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so you ride to <unk> to go tomorrow , early on , in <unk> , i one dude , they all welcome .
i 've got madd '' types , i said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i ' i started to do , based on <unk> .
do n't worry , the beauty , little <unk> , the blind faith , come up afterwards <unk> .
i , before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm going to describe what i the right place where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six ] houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents love the farm there 's an apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> , and beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but at me , <unk> and beer .
why i could use , i the story , where i 'm from ?
for me is one of these very important stories that i really that right from the country , the village , come , and there up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest one brother , the <unk> .
and do with the brother , the same way we think there 's how i .
i mean , the see light and dark , you can see how i just might also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light , is , or from .
what is very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , we both can you see , if of us anything .
'n pole , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> pole .
the to talk about the old men , <unk> .
and to go tapping into .
and what for me , but always , was critical , is obviously , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , let’s -- i time .
and the was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , of my brother and i still not even blind people knew .
we were so the first to then , which suddenly appeared in their lives <unk> .
and then they had scavenged from the situation of what do .

a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning to us to them , there to go , where we also our sighted brother is .

there has the blind brother and i 'm going to 'm <unk> <unk> mean by , <unk> used in .
the order to the order to i have to today still .
this is that with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham , i 'm a courtyard of a really that all troubles outside did , ma , you could do , in the example , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother , are starting with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to go down , how to many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that , starting with <unk> , no .
and then the big question is : how to be an ma , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents that the children , eventually brought back from a light and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently , where it go .
and our solution was that we obviously a , from our parents tell us have a divorce , the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , may also , very unfamiliar , things , homes -- the turns out you now , not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had in choosing to us that one i think , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now in here i 'm not all of testing , because you will it 's so loud you to do n't , and more of them .
but <unk> the evening when you , let 's light switch off , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom , and then they orient to .
you can of time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and , you that 's at us humans as well , bats are also -- they 're a resistance .
so how the bats , so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and that is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , very important .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i just to believe is no big trouble and now , you also , many accidents , the one or other , there 's course , .
what i 'm going to say no pictures , i did , that i very <unk> itself is , from one of our <unk> , as children .
which is the climb on our higher building on ♫ i 'm a courtyard .
i , let 's written , the confidence that grows , through a <unk> diversity .
and that my darlin ' i 've been very literally , because i was a man , the , much , later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side of busy . i , i 'm talking about one ever saying yes , or i never that stumbled upon how i am i was have experienced this .
i ' '' of it 's never leave you may also be when you read .
now , but it is also to do with that 's obviously not everybody that 's exactly as an experience .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with this is announcing to some point to know where i a good , what i talent and where i can you saw my strengths , also full <unk> ?
and our brother 's again , the , michael and i 've always been picking up on the roofs off the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you come from somewhere i 'm a window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes and then peel away , michael afterwards , and i , probably already , i still <unk> bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i 'm not .
but in the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the others , we 're yes , the next generation of young women , here , not .
and of so i 'm , then , but they 're always with .
and then was , the consequence that we look at all three <unk> <unk> up there were and the dad , i 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and i did n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because of trust is sort of course , then , when others to rule .
if the father so , to god will to help to help to help , if only , the risk of the relative size still have to one of us as well , by the tip , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would be .
it is , but never happened .
he had to mix , so <unk> that he told us that , again , <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , of us , then returned .
and that was , i for me very great that we keep these opportunities .
but now , you do n't worry that 's no value proposition , not necessary to later <unk> .
for me were the different kinds of sports , in my life , always important were , all , yes , interesting .
and all , they were all this <unk> , because i just as i could see , where i ' i mean , i mean , borders , what are perhaps like my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 've never can be .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i do 'official ' to do n't like in <unk> .
i do 'official ' to get out in the rain .
now , not at five degrees , like the moment .
and at <unk> rain increasing -- but rather than just inside .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with being discovered that i of sports try them . i .
as the first example , <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , of us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we have it 's noisy <unk> children , but they send me , let us <unk> couple of the blind children .
it 's actually about yes , because there you pack , anyway , becomes the coats .
and then you notice , what the other people power .
and there was always so my big trust , of course , when i the competition for many of making it 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and that 's a faith in my initial speed .

i 'll figure it 's not try it .
i had it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and that i also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' .
okay .
the next for me that was when you got in the school , you then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are up to <unk> and that they have , we also have taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school , it matters : how can i as much as well , the school to move to my excess energy out ?
so , i then a way in the school <unk> .


i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then you 'll find them , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you , condition , needs , you need power , ai n't good did , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work recognized ?
this is what 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you that all of confidence in the own humble technology .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the yield to snow , the <unk> snow , the skiing and when we can .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i mean , to <unk> <unk> .
and i think about this is still never give <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , just one -- has already today , my exercise .
it , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> , you now maybe just time .
do with a , a , one of you see , which still a different exercise .
what i find is always do the subject of the blind faith , is the exercise , the listener , just imagine making it 's on this is , if you do n't see that <unk> to make and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you has two sticks in the hand .
of so , right , i ' i do n't hand anymore , you could i mean , my darlin ' <unk> take and myself the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> and the front of me .
and the explain me with the voice , the route .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tell me just always <unk> , if it <unk> goes , tell me <unk> and <unk> , the instructor says , left on every 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of the old-fashioned technology at with the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 little sharper left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to again and of or he had to me again , i think again , i know , , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes , the very large , critical , if the <unk> ago i 'm going , i have to the really completely <unk> to 's time , negative to say .
the janitor 's being beneficial to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , just really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> , and faster than others , in the competition to start .
and that i can only way , when i am i just do , with both arms to me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg got to stand and i must now , the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open the exact moment , is yes .
and to be like this <unk> and to then on the other one leg and the way back to stand and you can not here <unk> bit in further , but to really care as being quiet .
also with high shoes .
yeah , and this is for me that very key , when i do the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i tell the guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , now , how do it , just to say , hey , you got to me the right <unk> do , because the right , it : yeah , ourselves .
the know , not , what he told me to say .
so i 've taken on the him the way for communications , you open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can i mean , i do n't help , but there i just wondered , and to say : well , i got madd '' of you the curve , maybe <unk> <unk> used stance .
or i got madd '' of you like now , walking , that you just showed me as well , says , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> booting up , because you think , some time : now , it has now , but over .
and kick them again in , like nuts and that thing it 's not on .
and there 's got madd '' i then we 've also , the pilot , how it , walking is , i 'm <unk> forward , i then he says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes left behind us , because we may -- so we ham and recently , <unk> minutes to -- then we 're it , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me , very important , there 's also the , weirdly fine-tuned <unk> .
i 'm like , <unk> -- here 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best thing was time , times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may i figured it 's said , never been so much faster on how thirty-six minute .
and the uncanny the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that this <unk> only then it possible , when i just mean your ears , frankly , i did .
the other just showed me , exactly explain , what he comes to form , it looks and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk in perfect , estimate .

so , ' sake of as a blind , not so much , i said -- from <unk> .
because i also , that experience we had to me a <unk> right , and the wrong with a firm stance had .
and then was in the competition and at the bad , because it 's next to the way across three meters <unk> .
and i am the three feet just <unk> .
of so -- again , but that was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> to , yes , around , to so <unk> <unk> .
and i think about it happening today still be permanently , that i got people say , left and say , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not so much .
but , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , like that if it 's time quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , again , it 's called the blind faith that , that i the risk of trying to .
so , i must be honest , say , i am more than anyone , we do n't see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' i took risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now that 's pretty all .
the driving <unk> tree , from the slope , down <unk> , i know , and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the , which then also be done , if that trust me just arrived .
and if you know somebody has found , just really , a hundred percent , so <unk> , i am i just need .
and so i , also the same carbon targets . i .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key .
you need the goal and i have to leave you actually also clear , which is about it really , faith traditions also gives us ?
because of this is often <unk> faster the term , you time .
i trust , or the or i think about ourselves .
but the very key is yes , that , too much depend on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> got to meet -- we want <unk> that sense .
and the sense , is very often that we just might also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks . i ' i am i the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now somebody for , or the i put in the case that can count , they said that mountain , up that i get .
and how do you , then , that you the bell mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i had course , on the advantage , i , some things that we did n't see , if it for instance , next to me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively unknown .
ca <unk> be an advantage , is heights , which is no problem .
and i ' , and tried to the wooded heights that worked , regardless of the <unk> i go and to time , i ' i then did something <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there will you with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
this is already <unk> bit <unk> , then up there is , and down the cars , you hear , you still not a lot to see how to there to know , now , do it hurts when i <unk> .
and things like for me , are always been quite interesting .
now , you to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i war , the , when i think there are so yes , focus , <unk> and you can just by but also got a new new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because , <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you about every day , 10 hours ago , and it 's some just hold still get
you go and goes and has only still rocks to , around , less and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun -- of years ago i 'm half the first world war and it .

the only then so that the only an exciting .

of so <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , he and i had .
because i thought i ' : well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i probably gets faster , how to the thing , charging .
but , it 's otherwise be quite <unk> , because you , to <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of change .
and really exciting about it 's and then , yes , something hard .
so if you then in the go and the air became somewhat thinner .
or if it 's next one off , then <unk> little <unk> , where 's left and right off .


trust , we have it is that i just said i did : well , i can course , she , my friend , and it was , a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have that before , <unk> .
but i got madd '' also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus to , because , you can imagine , if you the bell mountain just always say <unk> stone , right on one , left on every 11 .
there will you some <unk> , all .
so for us is a faith in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope , your backpack attached that i had in the hand , and i 'm then left behind her in which loosely <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , they said , so <unk> bit , the the stairs , which i did .
and you is then eventually the only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or , with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i just as well , already know , so on me ask , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i looked at the men 's really showed , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , because the top of approaching , that you just that goal really so again in consistency , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other thing is it , but also like that i was when i did , that trust , in me . i , that is , those who just because , now if i really <unk> goal . i , like that the top .
but that trust is , and other , the <unk> , like trust , just work .
when we then at night of the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , mostly , very ahead and behind us are the other seven people walked and the were always kind of the natural impulse behind us and it has been , every moment was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do , because why this because , everybody that it 's behind us can run ?
at night beside you also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the apparently .
and then i ' i eventually the time , oh yeah , ok , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you go to 12 years at go , then the first , no light .
this is , where geriatrics , if you <unk> is the air is being thin , so , only still where geriatrics and now , not more <unk> first place .
and then it 's but eventually , so the moment , where the , have said : yeah , man , that was really totally , behind you to go , because the friend of me has just showed me all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , so do .
have all the night of us anything , and the other in the group , right there 's also like the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it is now only <unk> hour , that she have to me then told .
or i posted her what 's very different now not from the mountain , telling .
and that to know , it 's still turn up there , it may also just bad about <unk> that we have perhaps the time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
what these things , also have this open-heartedness , can trust , again , significantly increase and it 's that that you so the personal medal but just as well done .
and it 's for me faith , then given , and it 's all , then the perfect , if you know that the personal medal and that , what 's really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
this is sort of course , in in sports and with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why that 's go to make -- maybe , i 'm not the value to test , or to look , well , but only to lead , very is ?
so i think , at some medals that , it 's so , in vancouver in the were six grams a hard .

now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but as i said , i think , the real , why you do that , is more , that you , can imagine : what i ' i actually been created and how i made some industry-relevant skills and very focused on a point .
how i ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in his team , that we all need , whatever , in school , in the job in which one thing .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need that people , in the we ca n't trust .
and if we then that goal in the head clear , have eyes and that 's also have reached , is that the best of evidence that we look at least in a project in our lives that could .
and if you , once you can , you can do it 's also , definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , that is , <unk> your nice maps .
what i 'm driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in basically , i could either be .

even though every <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science , collections , somehow get across the whole .
every station has at least a <unk> , where we 're kind of major issues of the whole .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you look , what it , magazines and <unk> for children there with scientific issues .
every program has somehow , a lot of their own off in <unk> , but what does that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing , can i 'd like to see , i can to read , but that that 's me , not themselves .
cool , cool is science just sort of the daytime , you csi , `` breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
on csi like a <unk> five minutes , you do anything with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i can identify .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox of the future , we will only dealing with the can with these technological issues and themes .
but at bay area that 's not for itself .
i posted a few little examples of time i 've been doing , like science , or science , and now , that a given .
well , <unk> , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now that the sunlight from up in this always-changing facade into very , i realized that time provisional well , which is focused , and then , somewhere in other that you , at the centre .
this was another large prints through the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so you know that this poor <unk> , really long , long to go , there are the <unk> time .
because you have to ask , like an architect , the n't actually somehow , a little bit about in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , entirely new , that such a mirror of targets .
so , what i 've found , new , is <unk> , & of christ , where he was supposedly , you are a fleet of an agent .
there is and i really , what 's the more design or an architect , or where he has studied uk ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such current to have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already now a few years ago , when that just sort of the media was .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .
the gene was n't equate to green <unk> .
genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations , where the market , really become have : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that 's supposed to be , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came to home , and i was my neighbor , 'd ask , you see , but not happy , what 's because this ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm trying been there for three days like a little gene in my bacteria to transform and that 's all .
so that was , what i 've tried to to explain so somehow a <unk> , gene , i thought , you can see the good old lady , when i of genes are talking to know , , and you .
so that was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , i stood there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted to .
but that was what the woman to be seen .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad outcome .
now that 's already well , ten years ago , and yet , that kind of consciousness of the ones .
genes , that 's kind of what we first .
<unk> i quite a long did n't even more to read .
it is , gene and technology , free and it , but really in our language , there 's thought .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , it a lot of other american corn , yes , do n't borrow genes of bush .
a different headline writers , <unk> , rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
the , but we 're not so old and it 's also is no matter , on what level , i be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid that 's it also not more time .
but that simply shows what kind of insecurity in the population is , because they simply not with the themes of interest .
nevertheless , we 're in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things that are and some of what the most really no idea .
and this is pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , this motivated scientists are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , interactions like anything , enough . and he does think , man , this is , what that interested , but the public .
then to that , the professor go .

good idea , i still not the public speaking , it goes to a <unk> .

<unk> , because we have a press left with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then some way out of ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , yes , but , who really ?
now they are the institute 's rarely go alone , usually have multiple <unk> like a common of , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> , really cool projects , then over the <unk> , the magazine , to the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> .
this is the way .
from the it will always keep talking about , in ivory up until the really , really cool experiments , then , actually speak of projects , there in these <unk> come up .
that are out on a magazine that are actually done well , there 's of all there 's free , but who get i 'm going to work ?
in basically , just the fact , for interest .
in the <unk> we call that 's always the <unk> the <unk> .

as a magazine , the audience , the fact , for interest , maybe about a have , where <unk> it 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i 'm going to work , but really ?
the <unk> , it anyway , actually .
the way , that was now , the otto citizen , i call him , mr. <unk> <unk> , under conditions of the publications i read , i tried , it 's not to expect to get i 'm going to do n't really .
yet , again , our future , we will only way up , if we faced with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all , the <unk> are the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he kind of voting to .
my project , my idea is to the way that we need to this little , young , you get a scientist working out of ivory tower , , really completely from its regular <unk> to separate , and he was there a course , to do , a seminar how to science , which communicates .
what is usually happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know , we 've been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's at us a go unwritten rule , it 's not after his job to ask .
when he the mouth does and over his career telling it , he told us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , tell you then , what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , chemical reactivity , <unk> , chemically is already nearly this same level of genes .
reactivity , treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , what is that .
the really teach them to pass , on , that 's enough . if you on a conference , and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want them , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , blinding glimpse , to say , just water .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little bit more malleable , are the school i , an argument .
that has for all of a use , <unk> , but , unsophisticated investors , we want to also know , there in the <unk> happens .

but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you , really a jury , and the to raise your project to your project a jury , very tough , <unk> , honestly , worse , let 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab , and your project really to rethink , how to really quite normal is intelligible to communicate ?
so , there 's already several .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in , each of the university of course , but there also get i mean , basically , just , again <unk> .
who you , because , <unk> the city in the university , some morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
because i went back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , anyway , of interest , there are driving , there , one of all sound .
that 's beautiful , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy to go to home and this is it .
so you down , i still on a second aspect to say it is not in <unk> the project .
those scientists are also , trained , wired , actually children ?
because of really illustration have , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children , their world , exploring , is the same .
kids who work , extremely scientifically .
they do anything like to learn from the walk .
they try this is , it work ?
<unk> , fall , no way to do n't work , next to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it , new .
kids learning is a scientifically .

this is normal .
but that have a lot of editorial illustration again .
and of so i think , really can work that only , after the <unk> of and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the school , there 's all these are the children , on their <unk> , and , there really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists are actually , i took the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then i get i also , mr. <unk> , the , then also at for scientific dispute with very interested , because the children beside him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him to do something that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked , that it , your bread <unk> has to think it there are paper lit , and you name , and shaking you may also the head , architect , like a house can build .
and not just get i then , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it just still remember that the first <unk> , i 'd have to have said , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that this is just not subject that have just other priorities .
a scientist to yes , not to communicate .
yes , i think i then , and i live to .
but who somehow , at work , <unk> is in a company , but , there 's in the next moment .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks were terrible .
the weather that has a big is through the calculation .
of seven , soon after eight years , i 've been asked , if i 'm here that they want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , up here .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me was that actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is that really ?
<unk> , that 's really completely ridiculous .
i then , but to know who is and this is because i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , as well , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .

i 'm from ceos in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i was ceo of <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or hit eighteen years .
the runs the zeppelin and here at <unk> .
zeppelin .
that a picture , that i do you here want to show the little one point , right , that 's really that a red , like a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , exactly this is still going to the size .
there 's that are the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to action .
this is also , what .
there 's about 20 thousand standing around world <unk> .
so that 's actually , no market .
that 's also not a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you do that then it ?
how is this really ?
<unk> in spite of and only 10 to action , because we can see , which , and talk about why .
so very quickly the history .
<unk> , so many of crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's started .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war around eighteen <unk> the bullseye in '' .

the have the london , of the federal and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time they come up , but not with atomic bombs , but in a peaceful intent .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had a 'm a campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly realized that 's become , what 's still going to put the old memory in there 'd put them .
and well , that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but it was in london a good dress campaign , except the weather in north end up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much for flying .

and has a <unk> for maybe that then to america and delivered the house .
that has a myth , where , that the german nation of course , again something felt , as well , which <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then , in new york and receive up with a pin .
and the german nation 's got up , <unk> , we are again , who .
this is in all about this is inside and that is actually helps explain a little bit of myth of this device .

passengers , hundreds of around <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then this was at the first broadcast live , these are the crash , there , unfortunately , <unk> .

also the other fm devices have been in .

the the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls come by .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and the zeppelin , had the idea , maybe you want to the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you , technically a great product has evolved to come we 'll notice that , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> zeppelin , that may still just to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , who has a lot done .
there 's many companies , because of corporation that way .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a real entails , the profitable .
there 's a lot of it .
the 've got me , i convinced , here come to come .
the zeppelin , is really a very normal power plane as any other small plane as well , but has , sorry , very spongy inside of a gas , the helium 's not evolve hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , in the water on and under there , and there the <unk> do .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
it looks a zeppelin , with a structure .
there 's two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward no structure and the are sort of how balloons , in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was built these are , about four , a kilometer .
and it 's only today , as i said only still <unk> in spite of minus to our own was , so around the only still two decades .
this is then the production , if a shell where one is .
the left the structure .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the origins .
it 's one point two million dollars , like a shell .
and is to <unk> , to <unk> , and also has to <unk> be , and you want to be yes , at that if , crack in it would or a hole that 's not on to tear it .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look , whether they 're going on the black holes in control .
and the end looks a flying airship on without the grow of like it 's there .
the zeppelin -- is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you look down here , the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six times four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights , about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
the .
but there 's a different trend , of us at about power and the have i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago forty-three percent <unk> , when i started ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were in their sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , the zeppelin <unk> and <unk> it , something that wants , you can say at least in these eight years , of course , an the <unk> , as well , in these eight years , the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by a fog .
the want , yes , that you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has been .
so a picture of that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , the e.u. , a program being remade <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come morning is just from finland .
that airship on here is equipped to is a flying his lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
the means <unk> <unk> .
and the zeppelin t , and going , italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .

there , so i just explain , up there are we just do with the airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want to have extracted from the subject of weather .
that 's so very good .
and here are , a few <unk> .
that airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .

i i 've got there just wonderful , as a warm days , i think it .
the they were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have to aubrey de <unk> as <unk> diamond , looking , better said , is volcanoes go for the underground worlds are , in their 're going through the erosion , by a million years .
just beside you , asking , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you to make sense of questions , for an idea of questions , after a sense of thing is it makes sense when the same time in theater at the film <unk> or the blood diamond 's gone .
because i time ever wondered , well , what we do it 's really ?
and what are we are there is really ?
the end , we were after two years , done .
the ode to actually , not on .
the <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then i finished .
and a tornado , the zeppelin was in the mast , then at that damaged , that he also , right down to stay .
i was , but not so bad .
we were there 's very good insurance , and they were quite a very happy .
that was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yes , what we do , a very brief <unk> from the from the studied there .
what we do , it goes , just to , it 's the complexity , it goes to ask , growth or do it was .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we we need to the zeppelin was always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , as well , inside , after 10 , six , again , the be replaced .
we replace , the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> time .
we 're a general aviation <unk> going to the of the germans <unk> and the european and we do that is , every time , and the time , even more like <unk> , or as an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and to and also going to get .
the question is , do you actually on ?
you want to take on to evolve ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you there really ?
about you on the market ?
about you on the going ?
and the course we have in my time , one .
and there , we 've also some <unk> suffered .
like , the <unk> zeppelin and some <unk> has sustained and this bust .
at the billboard charts , it was the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german age population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke it was , the population him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> zeppelin and the other companies that way , otherwise we were or <unk> i am today anyway , not here and also other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a customer .

two projects are , you failed .
so , <unk> .
the same time we have <unk> won .
because i got no image , because that 's what we <unk> emblem still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a partner , the technology , a new .
and that 's a great success , but at the defeat of ideas .
two who are , liquidate been , because it was .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
it was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america who knows everybody knew you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham the people have <unk> , have the airship that have said , 'd ask , again , again , <unk> , the power .
there can the did n't realize that , <unk> can .
and it was actually , twice as difficult in marketing foods that we might get to : hey , by calling , and it flies .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to transport , to transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same , once a half million .
this is the bad .
the zeppelin and going <unk> routes .
it 's the sense of course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we , also do n't do advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about <unk> sold their voucher could have and people saying , this is so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , which and whom , and up , in the family .
and we 're great 's .
which i and out messy to begin with the mistake that you think we 're she .
you could still more flights .
we have so a <unk> the <unk> and we were -- she .
so that is actually also not very much .
we do , advertising .
this is , one project has been studying the audi sponsored by .
and an audi claimed that made here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you know , sometimes , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , meaning ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has much change the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , that 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 percent are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
it means that we 're then the market , if it does one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future that code .
and what the end of david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said , just at the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> you .
do advertising , we also .
only we find no regular customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
this is not , has been .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so , like a bid takes years until you can to get .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also be funny this effect that easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so , no market .
yet we 'll move on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power of it .
they ask , just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money give you 're in the market ?
what do what do for this ?
in what form is that they 're going ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm kind of course , my history <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big , drag , <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace , three years <unk> , when i got out of vancouver island of risks 'm and this whole <unk> come to see what you have to me , that <unk> , that when i think there . i do .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , in the money now are and we did n't know what they do to be and almost took it to actually gone .

and i was looking for three years , greenpeace , which is that when <unk> and now i showed this in the hope , a long the future in the zeppelin to achieve .
zero , is that right ? it 's seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , i got into the eighteen minutes to go to .
why we are today in from mountains , or have plenty of ?
how we come to their ?
and all , what to do ?
what 's what it 's really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it 's also , the next to show .
a few years ago about , that still more difficult to have realized that , to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , and well , and over time to suggest that are the challenges that growth , for example .
all kinds of <unk> are rising exponential increase .
if you put it in a historical , long view , you see , the oil for example , what is a very short , episode in the story has been to be .
today , we can not imagine that 's kind of different about , when that oil and keep up .
you know the climate change the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time the columbian mammoth , we look at the last <unk> years .

you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you , a little bit more closely with to , real challenge to evaluate things that 's really to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , health .
<unk> it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degree , in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> , and more and further , bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , all , in asia .

it 's the end , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , it , much larger environmental crisis .

it goes to , is an extraordinary biodiversity .
the deserts latitudes .
the water is less and .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and that everything , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say , i time , on the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
so , what we all of the things out , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the valued metals out and the minerals , but also the power of resources are in renewable , but the scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as many of use to also the less than waste and cut emissions to produce .
so it 's why , that 's in the introduction , said already been the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , oh , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really different from living .
another way to rebuilding economies .
our technology , to change .
if we , just look back the hunters and moving forward , and there 's still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person , and every year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history , three to five pounds .
today are it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , unequally distributed over the earth .
it 's in north , more than with us with us more than for the earth is unsustainable .
and in other parts of the world , you can look at the africa , much less .
and there 's , we 's the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's basically , that we in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the world 's the but less and like .

and this is there 's there 's very colorful , which is , there 's many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean want , then we need to the subject of interest .
so we have to change the ecological limits what we 're everywhere , <unk> 's everywhere .
and that , what we here , <unk> lives have it 's not <unk> .
that has been reprinted thousands of mahatma gandhi , were as he said , the world has enough for being needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there are we , we here in the average life , it a lot of it .
so .
that was the kind of <unk> part .
but i always surprised that you the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
however , i see , which would say , you think it , like that the way to live , which is more of their .
but it is , and so , from the <unk> <unk> you need , but a rationale , say , i time .
so , what 's actually their ?
so , we have to find that we in our to share the world , so much have reached the economically , socially , quality , at the standard of yet to the average often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good or mood , but there 's people , and you sure , people that 's not that good can deal with this story .
i time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're going to a lot and to do .
this is the one side and we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and the other cause we that <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
how we in the defining factor ?
now here 's a a little piece of break .
this is also , what i 'd say we have and what i later tell you 'll is scientific , grounded planes , but here is it 's hear it 's drum , how to , first time it is that ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it me goes , what i 'm going to eat .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i really , i can the life to participate ?
but it 's also , which is how it to me , how do 'official ' i was have to be able to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived to quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words pop into the , the spot .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental way our human development , our there 's drum to feelings .
if we need is that we can , we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are strongly , or not sustainable .
the needs by se . still not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can kind of scientists , quote , i here 's only two sides called .
and there you of the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
for protection , for participation , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , after the freedom .
all this has a little bit about with money to do .
but to a lot of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life up .
so , i got the second important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , i 'm using the me to is available to me that needs to meet .
and there 's then , drum , that i can , with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money they need a little money you need .
strategies that are just my devils behave like i was my needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i .
if i little money 've got wind ' i different from my needs to try to meet as if i said , so much money on the bank account .
it 's first of the <unk> that this is the roof over the head , to eat , and then , the <unk> .
and here 's then , that can with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , that can , that , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies that 's made me to stand to my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk about one of lifestyle .
so .
that was the kind of scientific break .
and now it away , what we can do now ?
how does it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of clues .
now , to that , as everyone for , which i find .
but these are the the individual 's kind on a technological way , here is , one . ' i , a lot also about technology 've been and finally , on a political way .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have , i said , the danger is that we kind of the more and getting more and resources .
the end , the quality of back down , because that , the effects , even worse , so , and on us the back to beat up .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction , go , with less <unk> , may also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so more about quality with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of the technology like i can see every single thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee in the car , the traffic , how to that make ?
and cement , today , produce , i can make the house of wood to build , were for .
now , with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> that , so in the <unk> per <unk> , and there are we , because of what is also have time i discussed was is , there 's very deep down there on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
the services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how to do with more than a little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , nine-tenths percent less .
there 's many examples that looked like , you 've gone .
in vienna , to a seven-story building be built with two are allowed .
with seven percent allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , from wood of sand .
that you , maybe it in fifty years , not anymore to dissect it and then again in its parts and not so , so , very much less resources out it with all other , you go from there , the moment with the half and the goal is , three-fifths of the <unk> , the span of the house while dealing with this type of the <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , the <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is , really from the from the , from the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want to me , you go over the others come after , and then i like , you 're in this in this race in there .
you yourself , like , you 're seeing that i quickly to hit , and then they do 'official ' i was the new .

when i do for themselves at a year and i did a few years ago we have still have letter writing .
then , you , wait , until the letter back now to write , i ai email , is this ai hell <unk> .
to write , i had hundreds of email .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , that is the economic growth , we get that in a back .
but i did n't really time to go .
i for me and a failure is done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance , where i really , the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> more about quality to do .
one of my favorite one is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling book now , it so that it eliminates average person in us in germany , in austria , thousands of things in the domestic chores .
you can of time to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations of thousands of things had , i had a couple of them .
the have to the manage .
we need to myself to deal .
and less and people come to , with these all options .
and we need a raising the us and helps to the us , <unk> with these few things in the interest .
if only ' one . ' i really interesting , maybe is also , ai n't use the spaceship , there 's go down , one . ' i , also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead they own .
a real construction boom .
now , <unk> , <unk> , like , you might twenty years ago , somehow , in alternative it was developed .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
instead , and business , the easy to work , how do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years was built still , use and still about the other centuries , to use it 's about the end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture association between africa and europe and a one , and the world .
so that all the same with these resources to get those that 's only then it possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's not less about quality , because of us as it has already , to be much .
but it 's an important to the economy , the company , these products , those services , really going to the we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the big public policy to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention deficit of the quest to read , it 's been back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week , that 's the back after the bottom <unk> .
it means , a crisis that 's in the door , i think , and also , because of what we , very much , economists , we 've talked and with have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that it for all countries growth is going to the simple .
and there 's no reason , again , growth to have the way that as i think that from my youth , from the 1960 years , you know .
the part that , in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is so much like eight percent growth of fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today .
the are also about there , where we may ago , and fifty years were .
overall , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder , eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still much , so we will be good living .
but you must , like , you put up , that is , not even if we are zero percent growth would have , i would that , the next year , so much of , and consume and incomes , as in this year .
that we can well , and so we can work .
that 's also why not that wrong , because you these statistics you know , the show that growth on , for , not more with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in our mental illnesses countries , about the state , we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth , and this is not so closely , like this tells us and out of <unk> and how they all that suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you , time with the economy of interest .
and it comes , and increasingly , that , <unk> as a more or next week , one . ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to begin to grapple with .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , then a nobel prize in his <unk> so i asked myself that he said , the good life the good global economy , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily in the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , indeed , china , for india there 's the ai n't very different story .
and this is , only then they are also under <unk> , if we there , still growing , let and we just like , on this level , on this high level , we 're good on life and economies .
this is it 's also , politics .
it targets .
it going to say the economists .
it 's not just sort of the growth , but we should actually look , and measure and ask , what about it with the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
then we 've also our politicians .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of which is , the <unk> finally able to tax avoidance and not the work .
of you who are especially the entrepreneurs live under them , but also the employees , you know that very good .
what , to control someone walk away , we know all time , who paid .
and that could you very differently .
the resources are , reduces and so among the resources in taxes , and not the work .

that goes , but it 's nothing to you , a little bit better .
that conclusion , more or less , on all levels it in this direction , working , we can be hard , we as businesses , the right products , services firm than consumers , you ask us , what we actually , who do that what 's kind of good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the policy on the framework for them .
a couple of evidence , i was given .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the direction , that grow up ?
now , but nobody ever done .
if you the the quest to see if you the development can look at the last two years , it 's always , down because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth to create , but that 's the question how we go to the world , which is that we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> 's to do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the end , the spirit , we 're going to need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of them , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving , i 'll , and the story that later .
they 're going to have with the citadel <unk> .
this is this ai <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and a lot of this city , mind , and indeed .
one another story .
it was in one hot summer in reno and , nevada .
a man is , on once in his shoes , right about that 's really <unk> .
that him to it 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does everyone then one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> also not a spike in the thing , several times , there 's a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , there 's actually be a knife , and notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .

a company is <unk> did , with four letters .
the , or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike even and adidas are .
both have been refused .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own company .
<unk> it , the stock market .
on today , several thousand employees in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries around the world .
so much on `` the creative problem-solving .
why not something to create , what 's still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what is that an opportunity ?
this question that has told me , often did , in a tough .
if something has gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or a technology does n't work or whatever .
<unk> , little fuzzy memory , <unk> .
what is that an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> the <unk> .
what the difference can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> now , the <unk> of total of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people who can be when it comes to their own insurance .
i want you a few examples here .
the are so in fact that was the <unk> <unk> and the has it also a commercial .

my son has the woman does n't <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plants is where when i the intersection had reached , grew up a sudden , the bush in my view , and i was the other car will not anymore .
that very , who 's one is , right ?
the boonies .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two , almost died .
because they can send me , but at least that sees <unk> on .
the last thing i was to crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you 're a man , is each other kind of shelves obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
many of us in a <unk> <unk> .
and n't have to be that .
why not things just time i do differently ?
old one of things that we do the present , from become are , maybe i 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , using this .
for instance , <unk> that have yet these <unk> of their so what they are , these signs , or , the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what on .
also a way , right ?
well , the coffee order to stay instead of to <unk> .
or so what .
we have n't put wifi , <unk> you .
is yes , today , regular experience , right ?
if you the phone , not something you can .
or eat you with me , otherwise , starving , we both .
you have , creative .
that it 's .
i only ' one of the client or an environment , then go , and say , okay , that i like .
that <unk> ' i might .
a german <unk> , in the should do the current day <unk> , in <unk> .
once the sport , the current economic news , once upon politics .
if you there are three times the loo was , is you <unk> .
even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of business .
it was to be closely .
the have thought , together , what we do ?
how we 're solving the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is to form .

so that , an environment , wait on it to eat their <unk> already , which they 're able to .
it the time different .
a creative idea , and may also with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person is the power , currently not just a popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german jew in orbit .
already the second day , and that takes it , a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> , on the month , i voted , and you know you might say , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .

but why do n't time , currently experiencing something to use and creatively from his great opportunity to do ?
sometimes it happens , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it , just like this company , that you might .
so we have , you know that , which is what the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they arrive at the <unk> also , saving to is , a one-in-three chance .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car on , if you <unk> it ?
or at <unk> 's also have the creative to design .
and all that has to do it with humor , with happiness , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then he 'll turn from left to right , he 's delight , and i held in the stinking <unk> say , to the you , listen to seek this is yes , not a playground .
he said to me , at me , big eyes , but the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually has it right , right ?
why is not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and so as excellence in , but , sort .
that appear to is that , if a particular day on the week from then it changes , what in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on a different day .
so one other day we usually prefer to .
so the weekend .
this sounds , yes , already in the media .
on thursday 's called `` yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time the year , announced it 's going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it is that dreadful ?
we 've got all this horrible jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the front , this topic .
yeah , a monday , can ' i and the rest of life , you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , all over the social media is this issue up .
once was walking , i do the <unk> , one of <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look at me , like this .
what have the so in the <unk> , there 's like ?
and one day , stuck , i 'm in this business with these signs of to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , yeah , that is yes , quite a very nice .
so , with so i do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , i 'm a father of five children , but i 'm also my work now .
yes .

why that your mindset , because it becomes , which is increasingly , and .
somebody a present time as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , ' time a shift .
what happens to my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , let 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks at all right , like before .
so something beautiful to talk to do n't that is beautiful , it was clearly doesn’t .
the pink , we 've let 's the way that 's good for bicycle , drive .
there 's you a wonderful , the fly , the else in your eye into this would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
that lead to , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we like us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running and running and there 's now , and eventually it 's to quickly , this cycle , it hits the mouse and you , their shoes out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .

that 's beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it goes again and so there .
and that , what we as funny and figure it 's probably has the mouse looking at once a concussion , yeah ?
or something that it 's going to <unk> <unk> .
i felt , many years ago , so when i on was about one of students at home .
and at was , so the street under me , felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what is there on ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically , everything in order .
but how would look at about the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , to bring that test , and saw , i was score three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after two years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first , in the early been wondering whether we look at night before the end you can do .
i also thought , what 's actually anyone else , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities straight to me , to look , they said , with my family <unk> , something good for me , which i 'm doing .
<unk> , whether it 's not sure ai other <unk> there in my job , a spark off .
i was that we all of large groups that make me , pleasure .

and this was n't always the .
i was have to see , to that <unk> stress sick of power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot of the so , <unk> of me is it back from the hospital , i had been , after he 's a heart of out , and on once he starts as well , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you 're getting to die jogging , he 's always impressed me <unk> , you with your running and so .
now , it yourself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but , we also , together , jogging , go .
what ?
the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the population expands , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> almost call minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
of the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
that 's something where i think , to that goes to be ?
that ?
this is just in austria . that ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that everything will be healthier .
that 's so here on the left to recognize .
thanks very bottom , psychiatric disorders , almost plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the <unk> drugs , takes to .
also the cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do that -- sometimes you come up , it , involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good meant .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol abuse is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , healthy , and it , and with happiness is ?
and that , i was the last years .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that even though there ?
i figure , the job is not that , which gives us <unk> it , and make you happy to .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is , we the most of our <unk> in the work on remaking ourselves .
and if we do that they then why not that do that it 's going to us , that has been troubling , and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , provide more like to <unk> and to <unk> this .
these little had no , you , hopefully then this is .
<unk> is for a globe , liberty and environment .
that is , how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which the environment , do 'official ' i think that , with whom ?
the freedom . i ' i 'm here to do that , what i 'm trying to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , of us <unk> .
ever more of , more and more stressed .
and what i do that ?
the globe .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for , the test .
i had this for me remind ourselves by a few years , and i do this is constantly , .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in which the environment ?
and that is , sometimes you go , i in a coffee with my laptop , the seminar prepare a <unk> .
freedom .
the freedom , i can take to do this , what i could think is .
and do i do it also ?
the globe .
the last ted u .
and then there 's , people , me to explain why do n't that goes .
and why this at them much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , in .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't , the reasons .

and they 're in both right .
what do with our talents somewhere else ?
each of you has his great <unk> around .
the is yes , far too small .
that 's filled with the same talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do that ?
by the end we ask this .
or if we in the hospital will be possible , or the end of life .
what i started with my talent done ?
the way , who 's like it has on <unk> <unk> , you can be able to see , which is still access .
so where do we do with the same talent , is so my first question , as well , i consider myself , every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
the i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i 'm going to the spot , do .
this fortress which was the rescue committee for the <unk> as a shrink five hundred years , the enemies came out .
and the enemies , we realized that that 's an impregnable fortress so well , built was that you do n't take them .
thick walls sixties ways that <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors , <unk> , can see on .
i was <unk> at .
so we thought , this , okay if we do n't get , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
time looking at how long , the that there , endurance .
the <unk> it was from long until the day came , where the supplies , almost out it was .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to being slaughtered out to be as the <unk> at the bishop crowther , bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop crowther , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
on even see it down the enemies , how about the wall around the fortress is a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right , and in the early .
well , thinking , , a <unk> , what is that already .
it is to double-lock .

enemies are thinking , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' , take .
at night i did the scenario , , this is he knows the <unk> , there on and go from here is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> 've got down and they were in a <unk> .
because they thought , and that takes us to long , that we hold on myself not anymore .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the they <unk> .
that , there are the <unk> <unk> to form .
i like this idea that everything there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
sometimes we 're it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can help but do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have been right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow , because it 's getting there 's the plants , from teens brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there , blooms eventually come from these blooms fruits .
there are coming from apple here 's very popular , then we harvest and eat .
there 's actually do this grain could we then the ground and bread in baking .
because there any animals , the way up .
there 's people , then the products that it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
if you , but i think about that perhaps not that automatically translates everything is then it 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and , theoretically , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant to play the bees fly a very , big role .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , in time , food is n't there were if we do n't make bees have .
also that sounds like , so <unk> , because it 's normal for us is , and we need bees might also not that sense .
there 's now , some time also a very interesting movie , <unk> , to the subject .
and i 'm going to tell them , 's take a look .
now , but look forward , we went on the lord <unk> , which is just with honeybees are working , in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that he doing here in school , <unk> and he 's going to us now a lot about his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time , thanks to mr. <unk> and , the <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> contribute something you can think about that live in the bees .
and that still under a wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell the fun .
because i assume you can think that the most of you <unk> in the 're doing it 's now consider tonight is a <unk> company goes , eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to .
that do i do n't , no .
but perhaps make it me , you to get that they get these <unk> start to love or some kind of empathy to them to develop and you to go out for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect in the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young when i 'm with an incredible wife annie perasa married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in a charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in the modern agriculture and in the urban beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .

and they are that 's also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and do n't have been the ancient greeks the correlation between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful little verse of homer , he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping poet , go out to him to spark that it again , why do n't have .
but the <unk> go up to do n't have to do , but they send their blue are bees and <unk> now the poet the lips , with the wax master and we crawl in the mouth into , and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
hopefully you get me that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the men 's now my students with me , have built comes for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> the school , or in the <unk> in the college of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms with us in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied that goes up with me in the class , and we 're looking for a , put in place for that in a <unk> .
most of the window to the kids that can see during this month .
and of all things to the bees , then there are in the hose pipe , and again <unk> can .
there is then the window of the slot .
so .
and then starting at the big stick with me on the <unk> .


also important , we have here <unk> their , and here to the edge , fresh their , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the , they need to take a bad weather is , and do n't you can fly .
so .
that looks like then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and begins immediately the transportation , for <unk> where , or to the for <unk> place in the school .
and now begins , an amazing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class , you 're going to experience of at a crisis .
her people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he made this <unk> makes it to be paying attention to the queen sitting in the old people are left .
that is not so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .


you hear that .
they sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , in a night that if you 're now , the need to a new people to , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , opinions and you .
here is the nation , agree and it then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen would that people , after six weeks , not more exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and the first night out , you from one of <unk> a pin out a fertilized egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .

everybody , of you <unk> in the high had to say , how to do that go ?
yes , we genetically <unk> , is , all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now begins , an amazing .
this egg , what 's normally in the <unk> a cabinets , would have been going to the <unk> a queen .

and then it will be fed a minister of <unk> <unk> .
you know this concept .
and instantly it changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , time i heard that , what we eat , this is headed to all kinds of us will .
and the queen is that really wonderful to see .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
you see that in class .

no , that happens <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then the students to eight days , my graduate student knows , three , five times eight a queen , so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then so happen to the teachers that , wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the nightstand to the students each morning to five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , say , what 's because with you go ?
yes , i have to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , our queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the , their <unk> down here , <unk> , because you witness to , like the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really can experience then they 're going to the first is something .
this queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then you get the <unk> and cut these queen going free .
the first , what these queen , they spread her wings , and there are now , <unk> that people what , i have a queen i pulled that has another through their , you <unk> , they think of pheromones .
the nation has now again an identity .
now going to three or five days for those queen fed orally .
the <unk> forward , she takes you their <unk> <unk> .
the back from the they turn out , from the people of this <unk> .
and after five days going to that the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some of thinking now , i have time , like a <unk> in <unk> .
, to stop .
what different .
-- that we let me .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , because of <unk> out to two miles high .
you have surely , time ever seen in the zeppelin .
in the <unk> and is there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male terms of bees .
so the way , like in islam , where the man , different women have to introduce this is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone could come back of <unk> that the queen , and that the queen of it now in an flight all that , what they 're going to seed need to for three years , eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also a an experience .
if you 's done with the <unk> dies , and it , dead , from the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts to lay eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come , i one evening , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i 've got this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and you see it 's still the queen .
yes .
but then <unk> .
and around , mostly about 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> come from now here in a <unk> .
in a full stick , in a prey and now , that people the big and they 're going .
why they can at school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the children , that have to forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees are together but for the school is yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when he said , when he said , there something for it has the can a history , and after the other people .
look , bees and this ai n't a century ago <unk> years , we have a cave paintings , where the people , the honey and it .
a few months ago , in israel environment , years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees thought .
any human culture has with the bees , breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were in every culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece , in rome .
all they were in .
the human cultures , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that they get out there are now , something to find now in summer of agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the gardening , and flowers are bees are able to the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now , from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
so you know whether that 's so that in the <unk> the top , the top is , or this ai n't flat on after the top is ?
let me , right .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can cope with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> explore .
and then it comes to the question , how could karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has to the bees can see that in the beehive .

there 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> , the university students , the , in <unk> figured that the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> net of the wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , or deliver , and the bees , <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
and you see what these bees in the school ?

and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a aware of these creatures that specialized in basically , just for us who lives .
the bees do to wax prints , you ca n't give a a seafaring people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way , candles at making .
they 're able to the budding and outside , the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> they their people .
and now imagine , you time ago , in summer , that are their sixties , , <unk> bees on this is a narrow pitch black room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , at the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> one of antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and so you to him <unk> , he 's about to <unk> , one on <unk> .
someone , to the <unk> 're now is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and a <unk> to let , by it 's the <unk> of the people <unk> .
of course , there 's a year before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , because they do n't happen .
yeah , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have a few apples , if the bees are there is n't fly would sooner or we have to be like the chinese men 's the <unk> <unk> and they themselves locally .
there 's much more these interrelations .
you look at the <unk> , there on the meadow , is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows grazed down .
and there 's going into the bee , then , their nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .

yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , i <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to good end of those the bee keeping us the most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still just to the point to come <unk> .
my students to be wondering , every year when you this <unk> build and then you know , and with me , in the schools .
that 's now , not my <unk> but , i had a student debt and so , i said in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you get yourself .
and then he says , yes , i hot , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> , <unk> and i 'm twenty years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm , let me , they said , not more with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with the head .

and more than half the said , oh yes , that we 're also .
my students see here 's an incredible global appreciation and the put between , unquote , normal and the those people are used by the bees , salvaged .
the field with you , and they get more self-confidence , my students and a proud .
how you going to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , as you going to <unk> the <unk> ?
so , what i think , i , there 's the human being the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with it .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the direction , you lose the opposite sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he 'd ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends all over the world .
so welcome to show , my project .
this off my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a the female she .
in my eyes that 's greatest crimes of humanity , because it their been five thousand years .
the society against the women with still have six to a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years a <unk> .
you , think that i on the job , not <unk> .
and i feel not <unk> .
and this is because i was glad that i put in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting been arises .
for instance , this .
with a massive <unk> about the news from africa , after brazil .
the sail a plea to the <unk> brazil in the demise of genocide to the live indians from the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these large amounts of a match , that interest in the media to find and even a small person as i was his cause global in the language of them .
<unk> i started with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there was there 's war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings , there .
and despite all the cruelty , we 're experiencing , we experienced the other the infinity hospitality of <unk> , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted down , and our two guards at that you see here , with their bodies as living took of us <unk> , and the insulting said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something like i was in not another culture .
and then in a few years , i 've learned that you conceptualize islam , not can reduce the terrorism .
also , christians , yes , not be reduced on their terrorism .
for the <unk> .
the -- that <unk> .
but rather on the real value , how to charity , social responsibility , the <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then , from this <unk> female-pattern and she .
when i then heard that , nine-tenths of everyday victims <unk> are the rest 're christians and <unk> . i ' i thought about how can a <unk> like the islam , next to all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes , it 's driving ?
and the idea was the highest in africa has the of islam to the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for in the germans organizations that we have n't find it .
because we had to us , but now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you 'd like me to the throat to cut ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , and internationally , then we have <unk> our own conservation organization , started .
and they had a lot of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , actually win , can we needed the images .
it was a scarcity .
and therefore i moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera , these pictures .
the bad as a bloody climax of that i 'm showing you do n't , but i want to the crime looking out .
girl , the age of four weeks to the wedding be some of their parents and related picked , the planet , placed you down , the limbs , and cutting them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> go up with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , <unk> instruments , you have of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to attenuate this .
what you 've left is an open up the size of <unk> .
an take ? well , 15 minutes .
if they usually you can ask him to do these two weeks .

that was the start to something called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins it goes on .
the man to you open .
he still has never a <unk> she saw .
the uncle , have him , oh , ibrahim , is , no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> , and then one you very hard , through .
and if you do n't it says , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> you on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
that you had three months ago for .
in shock , the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are <unk> does .
and when , we are muslims have asked , why did you did this ?
she was the <unk> answer , that we have to do that 's in the koran .
nothing is in the koran of the opposite .
everybody , believing <unk> times per day in prayer , as one <unk> , the creator , is , perfectly , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and why you , well as <unk> person having worried that , women <unk> .

he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard and discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then the thing that , the practice is against all rights throughout the power to religion , we need to him one minute .

and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know , just that has to these are valid .
and it was being celebrated , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest pragmatically , the <unk> the country on his message that it is a crime , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical sayings , the hospitality , i think it .
and when we the country , eventually leaving to said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , will you now , all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you 're not anymore .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> , you have to slow to get to it .
and all , he had an idea .
he said , if you get the ten <unk> muslims , the world , a table to and the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo , in the <unk> and -- a mosque to begin with the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard , the idea , was thrilled , in , when we his notion that we finance this would .
and that we do it 's about medical provider , the support us .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , we put it 's been asked them had , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and he did .
over cairo <unk> at the years <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> the female parts of times by female .
the <unk> the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred with guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe and he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i <unk> i only still a vacuum , and <unk> personal .
and then i did you all your surroundings .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of that she was mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much on `` the , of islam is not <unk> .
we had , and doctors , but using the on their way , <unk> , well , you women 's where does , <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to show <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they , back behind closeted kind of doors , only two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in the cameras , announced , what you decided .
and the most important set it , that was this .
female she 's a <unk> to the against the highest amounts of value of islam , if you .
he 's an autograph the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done , but the calculation even without our celibacy on .
because the shame , over the abdomen using the woman to talk , is stronger -- stayed when everybody 's mind .
it 's why we have <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .

and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's , `` bless .
it gets us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then at conferences , right to look at highest clergy like .

unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage to put that well , to announce that .
over the abdomen using the woman you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities are gone , on <unk> .

and then it goes out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are , the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going , the time .
it are all of the hot rocks , and this is because i work , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice of arguments that .
but my <unk> that would this .
i want to the great message the highest clergy the world to announce the birthplace of islam is here , the kaaba , in mecca .
not , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all that and the <unk> king of my transparent up there between the mosque minarets if you .
how i showed this , a whole variety of have in the <unk> .
unfortunately i 've not , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> he would join .
one thing , to these women to help .
to the other to the time to show , which the real value of islam , are , instead , and demonstrate .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i may have this , in hamburg , first time had .

and we transparent , if you could .
and maybe i experience i do it 's still saying that little girl puts his daughters were n't even more <unk> to .
then , my life that 's worth it .
and i appeal , every , this now it has seen or has to join .
also not be part is already a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the at a step , otherwise , i kick it is kind of this stage , not decline .
and i 'm now you conclude the concept of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , <unk> .

down there we have it , in german .
female she 's with the koran , and the ethic of islam is incompatible .
you is <unk> and one of discrimination on the of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually , so that time .
so at the <unk> from that you as a refugee camps in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i first time , like a package <unk> .
and , it <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now rotten food have given .
the third day , we finally get resolved .
we were the trash to say , again , throw away then came a <unk> wife and those that just fiercely against <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
this is not , well .
that tastes , very good .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my homeland , we have , <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china , germany had fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i tell ourselves now .
but , it 's going to me about the people that run to have and to a success did .
but first i could use , i 'm going to where , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .

and this region is the chinese that would be in <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .


hundreds of chinese were trying to get after <unk> relocated , we 're going to be in our own home to a minority become inconsequential .
our own native language , <unk> was from the education is basically .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese students .
and our religion can we also not free to act .


that was also the reason , why my parents , for you 've decided to us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is short of our escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time behind .
i <unk> , let me , many people , at the run have helped .
i <unk> , let me , many images .
i <unk> , let me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it right in front of me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had this ai <unk> , , and we met him , with his little lada on a lot .
the first rate was to vomit .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees use , not for the fates are interested .
but i '' , say , '' , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> think that has conducted months too .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure the <unk> came out .
the airport in <unk> we came , and i know , as my mother to somehow i said that 's just turned out of the airport .
turns out to you do n't .
until we are out .
because i had , in my hand a pass , and there was also my photo in but there was a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> , let me , <unk> <unk> the me at he had my watch out in the hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we have finally <unk> .
in munich , <unk> ' i , of the first responders , sort of very strongly supported .
i <unk> , let me , <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used by .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least that 's the children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger whose faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was eating , you 've made and done homework .

just my <unk> the <unk> in the college , i knew them .
they knew my story and we went to me , and they took care , to me .
for instance , brought me give you to <unk> <unk> what i now , not more i do .
but they helped me , somehow , german people were able to meet .
i spent my whole place where the <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had , just a <unk> and we could now that was deported .
i <unk> , let me that i , really aggressive , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i must be easy to my history .
i was very , aggressively , and i was me in the school at some way to focus .
the 1980s brought us to find out to the catholic <unk> where we first time , to normal young kids in touch were coming .
with a normal , my darlin ' i children , not in a <unk> , had .
i <unk> , let me as well , <unk> the me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent them .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> , let me as well , several <unk> <unk> the with us done homework have , because our parents did n't speak german , could .
or the have with us just did .
we 've always very excited .
i know , how we always the big fence line up and waited until these people came , because , and there , strangers when people for us time , and that was telling us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
the problem was , but that it directly from <unk> after <unk> deported was because it in munich a supposedly , no room , for him , there .
i <unk> , let me , very , who she said that it has managed to my father of the <unk> after china to keep us they made it even notice that he was at us in munich , for .
i <unk> , let me to that time where i really , and then , really glad i was , because after six years <unk> to do we finally in a normal apartment .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally one of your own apartment , your bad '' and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was , very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i was my door in -- .
and i <unk> , let me that i the time , very well used to have , but i had yet , and college , without a school , and leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> , me in <unk> always been supported , and it still do with the idea that i think about the second and exposing and my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not easy to the time i made i do it 's actually going to the middle at that .
and i started to <unk> .
and before i started to <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project , the organized <unk> .
but i was n't a <unk> that i ' i also only done because we by <unk> a place , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the heads of <unk> helped us some way that we 're continuing problems to tell you could and he went to us and i could tell us at all asking , somehow help .
and i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and this is a project , where young people without a major in the opportunity to get , being artistic <unk> .
that has told me really very well done , and i was , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of awards .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never had had to people we were listening .
and that was like a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more n't .
i want something comes from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , came to me on the idea , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join me .
but because i put in the bold and buildings , totally enveloped me go , i ended up to be held in <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and this thing is that , after a performance of the two editors , from <unk> broadcasting , on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just time , your <unk> .
i thought , super , the golden ticket .
it is we do 'official ' i do with .
and i made for the program marking <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of my vital contributions of a play <unk> , i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i told him , actually won .
by studying , i the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all that would have to me to do n't have been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me being used to have .
they have to me , we did you have to me spaces were open , they have to me ways i’ve shown , i my place in the society , i <unk> can .
and to come , i now to them .
everybody 's got the way of people like to help second chance to get and their lives or her place in the society .
because the people , in every day come to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you has a huge potential .
they have it with great and determination to many terrible , but there behind it .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for every one of us as well .
and i could actually thousands of things to tell you can make , but because i do n't even more than enough time , to have even though there it , a minute , the world , i you a <unk> brought .

we scan you the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , then and we can do .
and that 's going to us very good to help .
i thank me already now , for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan you the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in the hand .
you so i 'm going to become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yeah .
first time a <unk> <unk> was .
to me that we connect .
my name is a robin chase .
my <unk> is write , simpler than it talks .
i come , of austria , that 's in vienna .
i 'm , let me and yet , today in <unk> to attend , is really beautiful here .
i 'm in a me here every time , very comfortable .
and this is not just spouting cliche , that 's a sense .
yeah , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not even today , here to give you about anything to a little overboard .
i was n't , about .
but it 's so , they said , text would write in my spare time and then some talk , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the world today .
yeah , and i was also today i asked , here 's a couple of text to read the image of the program a little <unk> .
and exactly the wind ' i now here do .
yes .
i start with a joke .
they meet , two million chickens .
and says that one , are two , chickens ' <unk> you up and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> already , very funny . i <unk> you up and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and says that , yeah .
hey , and just ca n't <unk> me .
here we have the level mandated .
the first text is a little <unk> that i time i wrote . i .
i , it at a person 's devoted , i know , and what has .
it carries the <unk> .
and , it has it at themselves do n't understand .
when your head in my lap , was sleeping under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg , was also under my ceiling , your leg , was outside the ceiling .
my leg , was for the ceiling .
it 's about her head is , on my lap , dear , the rest of her camping under the ceiling , my leg , the ceiling , her leg of the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg , extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text , i also at a person 's devoted to the me very much means .
and that my grandpa owned .
we 've ever since no contact with more .
my <unk> grandfather was from a butcher paper .
already memorized as a child has it with love drawing was cut .
me about that , yeah .
yes , 'n text .
it will be the world .
jesus is the only , their is the sticker , the glass of the bus .
but where jesus was when he took me , that sticker <unk> ' save should be ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
soon the text .
the text is a little bit more .
he takes a half hours .
so to writing .
and read it faster .
's the beginning of a novel , i degree in the <unk> write .
ah , it goes to <unk> guys , so the adventure , from a guy , again , the hair them and a little to a lot <unk> .
i <unk> , let me , but again and here , in front of the hallmark i distance .
because i '' ' i 'm never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head up empty .
so who looks like the sheet , that he now to fill it .
yes , and i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't .
i do , let me putting yourself also hard .
and that we do that , i play , like with my own lexicon , and with my language .
i , always been to me .
and yes , come , these things out .
it carries the <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
it 's probably the <unk> <unk> that i ever been writing . i .
<unk> we can .
yes , we came frozen .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , i do it yourself also have n't .
no idea .
yeah , clap of me .
i say , always , either , or no .
the next sheet , has also do with text .
it 's like a little <unk> .
i ' at the time for the insects and writing .
very polite .
yes , 'n text .
it 's a little <unk> .
and that 's about how cool , when i mean , i do that their three to tell you might be .
my text , the title , all good things are very cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we meet the <unk> .
so to cuddle this , <unk> , <unk> and from scratch and then is the better and yes , this is it .
now managing the moment .
yes , 'n <unk> , this is this is a other .
and that 's about how cool , when i mean , i do 'official ' that we all this ai kind <unk> could do , so 'n try that we all time .
alright , `` well , that what the wind power , .
the text , the <unk> and about this .
yes .
this is fun , you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write , so like little <unk> .
this is a visualize sexual pun .
sexual desire to <unk> -- writing .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
this is fun , you .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
it 's a very long sentence .

here , text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
he has it already know , before i showed him as such <unk> .
he has made me <unk> of just fell , then i would he told me <unk> .
i could me later , in him <unk> .
i was to the joy .
it as <unk> of all other days of quitting , and me back to sleep , we put it .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it 's not anymore to honor , by i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it , not going to a going day an accident .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what i said , and albert einstein , when he would be a steak , not she liked ?
i of a q .
so .
the letter q and sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the text which has also the middle of her learned .
this is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially very of you .
and that 's wind ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and yeah , because i ' i that text is written .
he carries the <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i from her .
yes .
we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , this , '' ' i 'd like a little do advertising .
i ca n't business or so we afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and that <unk> ' i also have the events , and i ended up , then also have a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can walk like , come .
and yes , i <unk> , i <unk> , actually very likable .
and , yeah .
that you want , ' i just have said .
it goes on in the program .
more .
this is a little advertising , i time i wrote . i .
feet .
rich , vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
already , very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your friend of writing , but the punch it was just pretty flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thanks for listening .
you were great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me give you the same with a <unk> question i started .
why would you <unk> actually do ?
now , i think everybody , the tax money , it should , whether it at least some potentially of society , what you back .
the answer is very clear .
we know now that the life , at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> .
it means that 's going to have any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> .
why we know it still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by the <unk> messages from the <unk> , to become part of each other on ?
you remember , all of fifteen years to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , we , we all have and be healthy the old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in the supermarkets , has led and what does n't touch it has changed the americans every year 's become inconsequential .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
so it 's going , ai new <unk> hurdle , through a 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
well the reason is for my taste of to the least , that we by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated cases , of wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> alone is here .


the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , i was seven years for the number one actually nominated vice versa .
then , the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one person , the evidence shows ever attempted on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people , say , they are six , but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> .
and they listened to <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> , to then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the virtue to follow and stop mobilizing to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not enough of cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us , aging , very complicated is , and that we -- what we need an easy experimental media systems and we need to simple questions .
ai n't very simple question , and a very simple issue , in different countries , preserved , is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone into the <unk> so , in the male <unk> produced is .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for , and think , if that 's a <unk> <unk> .
austria 's a free land .
but it come still better tips , not afraid .
that should we 've got correlation was with this causality , to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's easy to the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there 's visiting so somebody using ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so different done or another way to eat you to that old become are ?
ah .
the , which has every day , cigarettes , down .
this is the secret of their ages , right ?



for instance , there ai n't very hard statistic that shows that people that <unk> in the <unk> to get older , when people that do n't do this .
do .
this is that would reproduceably put them .
is that , <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in the pocket have to , well , to her age and the <unk> of them to take care .
if i but a bunch of animals a <unk> to forage maybe give and this group with 20 percent of you live longer than it ai to a group of the <unk> because it 's not get , but otherwise , exactly the same way that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet for affected .
and actually are these attempts have been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very -- at , but even i do with my enemies , agree 'm is the twin said that live up .
and that works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing you live in the much longer .

and it 's not , skinny .
it works , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , in the united states has been done .
what , you did here ?
this , ai <unk> and has one of this so-called <unk> to human , a <unk> diet , where you so , <unk> this day and night get .
and who cares about it , mice are about this has to get sick and have this ai n't very bad <unk> of out and bad <unk> .
now , you ai in common with <unk> and the has the right in the same number of the <unk> looking at the only that in the ai n't break .
the have the day , thinking about food to , for you have at times as much eating .
and these <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
although , both animals <unk> does .
both have to you ate too much .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when , and they were organisms , or stem cells replicating food taken away then she catches the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds needed them to that spawned again , energy .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , it , <unk> form of to junk , the ages <unk> .
the one then with the stomach , if there 's going <unk> and the cell as energy back to put them .
it will leave you damage the age , accumulate in the borders that .
this is about the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , to it so , twin said , they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's likely to take that , who works .
and we learn from that you to do it 's not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should have to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe it just the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and that makes it also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of history has the human being what did , when he got hungry man had ?
alright , he is to go .
we go out to the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe , the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden , look for us very different from .

the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let , too .
and that 's kind of the real <unk> .
we 've so on the quest for all made the molecular answer the <unk> turn , although the organism to eat .
and that could for people to be interesting to their <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might have a the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
so the question is that we can <unk> , <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , the thousand get it scans , natural substances .
we 've actually , a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all of organisms , naturally does the , but also in all of organisms , during the halt even less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to give an example , and then you see here .
this is this ai is through the cell division here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very , just look like .
and that works in different organisms .
for instance , here shown in one <unk> .
so we have this ai substance , and the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so , no longer .
and the answer is again , you see here , ai typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , it 's the days is about half the dead .
when , we <unk> the water , there , here in very colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we of <unk> ex vivo <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we do you with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research on , too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> up .
and it 's not only the life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are really <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where is <unk> ago ?
how the name , says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , because it comes in very high concentrations .

we 've then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the junk <unk> it then you may also , <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we 've actually , experiments that .
they 're going to wonder , we have the , flies .
man that will see , a forgetful memory , if you 're going to get old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you 're going to get old .
and the molecular mechanisms , that are areas of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the fellow and the memory of flies have measured it ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stephen , these seals from the in berlin who did .
you take a hundred flies and put that 's a picture , which one another , they love .
<unk> .

then they take the same fly to give you in the next chamber , and give them <unk> other hand touches another , they love , which <unk> .
we do you make the <unk> enjoy , while , but it eliminates <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then they take back the same fly to do the here in .
the driving this degree in the <unk> down , there you the .
and if you down here , which are going to give you off the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> this .
where you go all , to ?
it .
the <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i do 'official ' i do n't get through this ai <unk> payoffs to corrupt .
okay .
this is , but this ai n't form of character , with the age increases .
not only at flying .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , at the back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain came that were , again the ground .
that go <unk> does n't just , aging , but also , <unk> diseases , maybe some .
and that 's important , because we want , the <unk> not the lifespan , by se is prolong life .
it does n't make sense , the era of <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't get them , without them , a few practical , tips , to do we 're some younger .
, <unk> fast .
it 's not that you gained weight on or so .
there 's the way , now in austria ai group of <unk> people , a day you eat and a day , and i did n't eat .

and the keep the very well , through .
that is , it 's <unk> .
do you <unk> .
it 's not to carbs , complex , carbs , but they do n't be dangerous . .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now , that <unk> burst out there are to get diabetes in , even then if you have .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate .
here you ai <unk> , ago , the ages .
after 30 days are the all dead .
thanks very low doses of glucose rich .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that .
food they routinely out-performing the fruits and vegetables .
do you the gift of to a lot <unk> or of <unk> all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer , we can now .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we 're here maybe some degrees ' in winter , <unk> , because vitamin d is driven by sunlight on the skin has formed .
some that you least three times per week , ai half hour , sports , that 's completely trivial .
and cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of you <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do they engaging in times the eternal <unk> occasionally the quiet .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to back .
because the monks in almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> lives are still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that has to do with some really all business .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then a plaster ' i the with <unk> <unk> solution .
and what kind of thing happens is probably in her around .
<unk> them , <unk> and so what , going through to get under conditions there <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or this ai family , longevity is associated with .
they should n't , a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now if you see in <unk> .
that , but with <unk> it 's nothing to do .
it goes to <unk> .
you can measure the closer to anyone in terms of the busiest streets the type , the more <unk> 's the blood .
and that 's , if he says , i was they were used .
i can already well to sleep and the noise , i do n't mind .
not true .
he has yet , <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight and it could be because <unk> course .
we know now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
all , it 's the <unk> down .
and we also know that onions and <unk> mice , you 're infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers will also , the us with <unk> and so <unk> .
it 's not without any sense .
several charities that evidence that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> , are we can .
just recently is a study with that has shown that it ai for half the board of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> of <unk> on the level of <unk> bring it .
with suspected that you of coffee is at the but it thinner .
there 's trials , that show , there 's trials , that 's not show .
what it 's is that coffee , diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .

ai n't very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to fifteen years long , where they were have demonstrated that people that every day , ai handful of nuts to eat their <unk> to 20 percent .
this is a huge value for the ai <unk> study .

but not for the peanuts and the <unk> seen , beans .
the give just , by , you nuts call , okay .
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts , is the world .
the next thing is a little bit .
do you the tape of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , when you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
ai n't very beautiful new study shows that you , if you in this time to a lot of animal protein to , take you <unk> so strong , increase , as if you a strong smokers , be .
this is not for the time , where the animal protein , which are good and it 's true of course not for <unk> children or a juvenile , the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and people like that 's going to .
generally not do you <unk> .

everything <unk> heard in the pathology labs .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it out of my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very good .
he 's just not <unk> as not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's one of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed that i do you today i said .
we should look at all the <unk> way it ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
which is that <unk> the halt me in a biological limits but a social seems to be , and so , a -- .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of the <unk> wrong with our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel at the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece , the contemporary of critics of the adolescents , fresh <unk> .
i thank you .
i want to start with a question , i them in .
a question , where now , no up to , because that 's a bit of intimacy , which of you who 's really lonely ?
the output is , very low .
one are still as i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , the people that for , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
and it 's not liking that the case .
will see , and loneliness is actually a phenomenon of people than just straightforward .
maybe that 's it also remember that do n't who have , because the question here before .
it 's like to , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can , lonely , feeling , without feeling lonely .
and you can be lonely , no , in the moment lonely having to feel .
one has also a lot with a shame .
also that 's some now here from have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness that in the shame and realize that in one .
one takes time .
also is therefore , now here , nobody who have the past few seconds , that i put them have this .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to , of all aware .
and loneliness is also need training exercise to talk about .
and this exercise we actually have one time .
we have neither the language , we have any sign for us , to recognize when we are lonely process ?
there 's the one two <unk> , which i and so i 'm .
the one part of humanity , you is from beginning , lonely .
of the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go then we often to <unk> and drive , the whole day .
i ' danzón no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's maybe people , nationally say , everything is with all connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , so , , thinking .
the thinking , okay , today i a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends , and it all together .
if we , and loneliness to think of us , the first of the very big one , a .
the one of dying , and loneliness to the person on a pediatric intensive care .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i 'm going to do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where it’s loneliness to us , like a theater to face .
i want to do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
one in other to kind of us , mostly , not difficult one at us to <unk> already .
the photographer and christine , tailors , the break a few pictures made , i want to show you .
how easy it 's always gets into account , the other and loneliness to detect .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really in this moment , lonely she felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talking together , you yourself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know that it 's all .
may have some of you today , already seen .
what you about it 's what you do that cell phone out very often , that could you today , you 're seeing is that doing that <unk> on the mobile also an escape the <unk> .
clearly making soundwaves visible , if you on the display , we look .
what we now this is n't do .
yeah , and then there 's the one , the types of them is the one of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces ago , and you even something out in the hope that you to their text , not forget .
these are the <unk> , you , though it .
that we other people on .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , from birth , lonely , feeling of their entire life for so he spent have , by showing you have tried to this one of , <unk> , to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room , guaranteed , people that are feeling lonely , because they 're on one other people up to be so it because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it also not something that still so many people , people , where they 're connected to move around you are you feel , lonely .
and there 's people that have the connections to , lost , no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you look at the analog teaching and loneliness .
the analog teaching and loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who are so after their , there 's no , social contact .
also that 's always had relative .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human contact , when i do n't .
us into there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities in fact , very many people at facebook or by reading twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness and bigger and there .
you can with hundreds of people to be anything , with a single person who really connected to be .
it 's the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital and loneliness to the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often over <unk> .

whereas the digital one , well suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's kind of them to go out that the digital loneliness to the future , you gain is when the possibilities , connect to be bigger .
i do n't know that you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similar to be going , and loneliness to call it .
or whether you for and then a new word that there .
but that are also , the problems with the successional generation .
almost more than the one of itself is the fear of the loneliness and from this fear of the one are some work to be ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the root wolpe describes her , what people do everything to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , then again , are feeling lonely and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear of the loneliness to kick out , which is to spend money .
and shop , go .
that 's favor .
both the process over , the one , because it at the short , in order , the objects themselves , you are acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly led to help and holding , this kind of those potions for the one .
so we have to , new things to buy us to <unk> .
i ' time the advertising for a a <unk> panties label .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications , if you be doing all of it .
what this at the panties , to do , you know you do n't , but it works , that .
one has so nothing with the <unk> to do loneliness to find under the people that instead .

hand on it 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to be waking up or the or the other the brushing your nice to see , suddenly the fact , just to feel , terrible lonely having to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?
i ' i have , even something to do ?

of gaps missing , because i now , not more you know , if i the study , even invented , to have so often . i ' i they told .

that intuitive , so completely obvious thing is , almost have a <unk> .

talk , that little bit about the one the sex .
this is also has probably already , everybody had .
so , while you <unk> is , suddenly manages to think , what do 'official ' i think is really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that 's not what to have to do with the quality of sexual are about .
also have nothing to do have to do with the quality of relationship .
they just is always there .
we speak only do n't about you , because we do n't you look .
we talk , right to do n't about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one , <unk> than we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've been watching a group of five <unk> , better , three on death suit and two people carrying costume either .
the two men have , and entertain the two women in a costume designers have to talk .
and in between what was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in the hand of an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene do n't turn out on so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also have time in his the fabric has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the one of <unk> .
but it 's also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , in this may also some of their lives , something , <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in become bars , often do n't know more , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also this is a form of loneliness to the n't talked to .
just so it 's also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> to misuse it .
down here is insulation .
i did , <unk> told that he 'd been about one of the clients , and the has said , it 's what , then , this happens , you can do it you did n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so he has to itself , <unk> guy .
and two months later , he 's also on .
the one never comes out by so .
they come , in conjunction with other feelings .
well , beautiful siblings , and ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , of your desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful 's not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look , and loneliness .
and come and goes in life as calling tide , and floods occur .
let you , and let you 're not from her up .
because there 's still a lot worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may , sort of loneliness is if you do n't even more to track them .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one thought i have , for me two things .
one thing , in my circle the <unk> i 'm not even more like a autocratic dictator since i realized i did that i just mix , who 'd have why him , not in and because i thought of have may be recording i the people , you might wind ' i lonely .
i think about it 's been able , since i the one in my life is yours , to have people come and go to them .
so just about the <unk> , you that power .
also there i can become .
people come and go to let , they 're not anymore , to who , well , from a brief encounter a friendship , or even a partnership to what could .
as a child i found my parents bought an embarrassing .
the can , any <unk> by , without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
if you at the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an average .
as a child i found that as i said , embarrassing .
as young adult , i know you just looking for <unk> that to can this openness .
but first since i even , and loneliness to work with you have to make it me at least , again , i was also <unk> like to open .
you see it 's really lonely , i mean , willing to do for the next to play .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i , here three seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now that , i mean , if you just once into one of which is totally make-believe , they would take ?
the most of you , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we have , of effort on the effect in .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the key measure with the largest negative effect , except for eight and make us for other strategy .
we make us , for example , <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we make us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want you today about how you with the least of effort into the largest <unk> achieve .
if you , with the prevention and health , too , you going to a subject does n't , around .
and the issue is overweight .
and the subject of obesity , was in germany , long time , no issue , so about to the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany and strong .
and i wondered , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why was that soar , suddenly , up ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> .
because it was right in the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we 're going over and along ?
and i keep on .
<unk> comes for , germany .
and that obesity , up .
and the years <unk> take the curve , right , rapid .
and what comes and then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how does this is .
and we 're going over and along ?
well , i was one , and one was cleared .
because it was , right .
sports , thick .
and of stuck , i 'm not here today , to tell you that you got this power .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've now in volunteerism that .
the tide of , new and training -- and <unk> has not to run by that we are thinner and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the atkins diet ?
and also there it eliminates these very good study of the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they 've got into the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to do , we look , so what happens is really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , less fat on , but the people take anything that are fewer calories to be but nevertheless , and along .
and this was a paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can this for us ?
there must do the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here , it eliminates these great <unk> .
and the one side of it 's a <unk> , i do we all the coals on the be here is burned .
and this is where the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more the coals on here in to give in our power than we on the other areas of <unk> , the energy in the power and it took off .
the human body does n't go right off .
the can the energy to store .
and that in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy and then it 's just a conclusion to .
the <unk> , that drastically reduced .
here is n't live more than it .
we 're yes , only still up .
and what happened .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to a fluke .
and we come today four types of even on a to two miles and are the positive , that .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that , <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
give you me degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you 're likely you degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he 's not going to talk too much .
and he was at this trial and sitting now here .
he 's this typical southerners <unk> to me to <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in the hand .
and mike eat less and and less and and takes only still <unk> , and yet it 's over and along .
why ?
because it 's mike 's only still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much more movement that mike , so the day , and i told him , a step counter the back in the bag will put them and at night i went back <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance that mike , at has the morning , from the kitchen to the car with the car in office there , of course of a coffee out and night coming back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
it means that mike was , that day , 10 minutes on its legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of america alone .
and mike 's not why did dick , because it to be much eating , because so long it up again and energy <unk> this , but not waste of he will inevitably , and along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> , the energy , as you see here , his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that is not there .
the <unk> , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they were active and <unk> still , and quiet , his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the physicians of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , it 's all this little black holes in this <unk> .

and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flowed through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on this is a <unk> true , it 's also in the body breaks off .
and if that the heart , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany and dies every second , heart and the stroke .
that go in germany and dies every second , <unk> .
and also mike 's so not so sick , because he does n't like sports is driving , but because it , does n't even more than moving .
and if you have this do n't know , for you always , in the wrong .
for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday , caloric-restriction diet , amazon went into and get there environment , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book , just like a centimeter is thick and we were the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there is inside and now that 's really important if you more energy in so more food as they consume and then you will be thick .
and if you less energy that when they consume and then they are no sharp .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , books ?
that 's just a conclusion to .
the need is obviously this huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because it fails of a diet , a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what do the things that we here , three weeks to make and here , five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , and to our normal life .
what is , then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .

so to do they go from here today , everyone becomes a diet , every new <unk> questions , and you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end n't come out , it 's unbelievably pure time .
it are the habits , to decide whether we 're going to get sick or stay healthy .
it are the bad habits , sick .
and it are the good behavior of us healthy .
and if mike , in the mirror at then he look , the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , we look , then he look there , everyday habits .
and if mike , in the mirror at more honest and to , is , you see it 's , where it is on .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then it 's just the disease , the way .

then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and the a <unk> habits and mike 's also a great example of the person , a weird animal is .
mike , it for instance , did , moving out completely his life <unk> by it every way to the car , which goes out of you an escalator , using , every lift the use .

so , it , in his <unk> which goes into the gym . there with the an escalator , up what yes , by se , this is , and will then how it eliminates rat , again on this is a band <unk> , so he somehow , movement .
and my grandpa , would have , that any as you .
the was a farmer and the have that 's not understand .
the have said , sport is for people that , not move .
and it 's also pretty much .
why we have to night in our very precious and play , that it provides what we the ground forgot to have ?
being taken , we have today with this <unk> lifestyles after two hours of sports can make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a different perspective invite you .
maybe even know , they also the situation , you drive the evening , quickly to shop , and following , in the front row — no way for free .
and that you see how we 're , so i sort of <unk> in us .
we 're always the shortest because of go .
we plan our homes that we the <unk> ways .
we plan our whole life that we the <unk> ways , but that brings us , but not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so we can you . ab now the <unk> activate and the back there are finding , where they 've been up .
i drive down , like to the track .
and i 'm the only , always waking up and down and up and down there 's now , and everybody else .
but if i mean , already , because i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , that 's just like this room .

environment , steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and the a <unk> environment , steps , if you go from here today , every day environment , steps more , then that mean , the end of the day , 12 gram of fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of the time <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are , crazy , imagine that here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are one . ' i four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what we mean , what happened just happened , if you really in a phenomenally active life on .
and these <unk> the things out , you go from here today , every day in their day-to-day .
once you , <unk> steps per day , which are going to walk you virtually everybody 's prevalent it .
and if you then set out and i have time in sports and then they do that on top .
then you have to the <unk> also , <unk> .
then you will also still evolving faster and stronger .
but do with you your health , not more on the amount of sports .
so they make your health , not more on the amount of like it , and of their time .
because the critical , the that they doing now , every day as much .
and i <unk> ' a active life <unk> .
and for me , it 's now more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based on for the lives and for me .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
you decide , ab now just , for the greatness .
and ab now you can also how can .
step for step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually done on this incredible , you see , in the world with others ' eyes to see ?
and , so far on that engage in what to his time , just simply inconceivable , unless she was ?
we could have that also now ?
that , maybe what with companies to do ?
and how can all this force and confidence for our future to draw ?
we start , on , with the question what we understand it 's out of innovation ?
it .
technology and invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all great .
and we can do with quite proud of this , and be grateful that we <unk> in fact that you fields are that our technologies around the world to be that it gives us well with it goes .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique prosperity that have .
but look like it with the future of ?
the challenges , because when society based on us to ?
and who cares , because the large low ecological and social engineering challenges ?
so <unk> , it seemed kind of fine .
a kind of labor .
so the same thing , the ecological challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort , we then the productivity and efficiency .
and the the world better , we want to make the finding , nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens ' and the need to actually , what companies , so if you 're entrepreneurs of course , then the damage the term capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we looked at the than that are separated at to ?
how it would , because if we <unk> the ai social and cultural references to expand this ?
if technological innovation in the same as cultural innovation are ?
if economic vitality out of the same as social innovation are ?
if it gives us from ever leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different people have an unknown , these <unk> and if it gives us even a very different , and fair <unk> of great cost ?
because as i was that ?
both sides to have , but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may come .
so far we have that yes , as a deal with the way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .

and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> , because of what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i was for the nobel <unk> get .
the opportunity because of me , i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar .

'n very subtle of young guy .
it 's trained , which , but also , they allow it .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i like the , like .
and if you can to see , you think , oh really , the offspring , because we need to us to our future , not about .

that he doing well , as it .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , something that 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not be more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that the entrepreneurial , he says , .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and like that he also .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the , he is to be recognized .
so not that he asked him for you know , but that the <unk> says to the , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , the more he was surprised when the him , then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , it , then there are introduced .
the janitor 's great boon for , so with young people together , there , his experience of science .
and the two , then you know each other .
and have , more met .
how it would , because if we now , in a lot of these conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how was that because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> a company ?
that i still not so , understood .

so the name says , yeah .
were markets , established products , established business customers , established structures , there 's a history .
and you can also quite sure exactly the quest . ab : there , where the big one is causing the .
and time , ai ai <unk> , the very neat is can that 's also .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?

it 's something very different .
it has yes , a completely different character .
because it has , nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of why is a <unk> a little bit like an organization , give the purpose is a business to go to find , to the impact of this is , of course , but , would reproduceably put this is , then we scale it .
and you certainly understand that , of course , so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , right .
but after what we look for because it ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then it away , there , as <unk> <unk> to make money or ?
so i ' there , degrees , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin who would you me that would recommend it ?
that means <unk> .
as you say , your companies to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> it .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money did what 's because after your <unk> ?
so we start loving you just a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what 's going to your commitment , and i know you ?
and we look , the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a lot worse , financial situation when i 'm in your great .
money is always the outcome of a successful company , and a good and it a company .
now , you money is an energy for fundraising enterprise actions .

but it 's never the goal of a company .
yes , what is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , i guess what they do 'official ' i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , the targets should be , and then and measurable in time may be so on .
and when i think that all right there 's not . i , so that as i can for something of the i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risks in this feels , for me all so i think , and inherently uncertain .

but i ' there might want to tell you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost , secret .
and on the <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for wined .
so , or how does tell you today ?
<unk> one . ' i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> this .
, for the crises and <unk> and <unk> more of uncertainty .
so it is guaranteed .
i think , i can you one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thank you , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask you put them .
that can you the same time i remember one of the basis of enterprise qualities , is good question is to start .
we in the time , after the other through them , they said , perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want to do this happen ?

what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see it ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of learned ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot , wood to collect , but i teach you , yearning for the sprawl , an ocean .
yeah , .
so then i look , i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?

actually could color in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you 'll have a if you <unk> , what you do n't want it 's then it , you 're going .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
it 'll tell me , there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass , on .
reset it tells you , no turning pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it , right ?
so no turning pink and elephants .
understand ?
no turning pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on it 's focus on that , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , now , you get out , you that i think of what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas the <unk> .
but we displace it 's not to visualize ago .
the way , what i just thing you like , <unk> right ?
i , you , there , with them .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you up to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .


<unk> from <unk> .

the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?

you what i noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower here .
okay .
so , and then we can look , then we 're looking at a time where the bear with that 's .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you up to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .

so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first time , i did .
i thought it ca : yes , probably not was eradicated .
and , a lot more shocking , i was as me through the head into this is it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and admittedly , i mean , this is yes , meaning .

but what 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i from ?

well , thank you , then we get , the next question .
how i could actually to my goal to come ?
so , i find that this ai n't good question .
that 's like , when i think that every time , and i know that somehow not on going forward .

that you get lighter and fall when you may have n't know what did .
because if you your care of what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n in fact is very rough metaphor also presented so what did i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you 're going to do n't really differently , when that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things on you are kind .
that are then these famous <unk> , you get up under the shower , it .
and , ai n't question i 'm going to tell you , to look , you a good to , who you have them could who you to take an interesting questions could talk to there more input , more at mit , home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great want .

to lunch , the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , as engineers , architects and he has this ai n't very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our modern day senses , where it , went , who sit down , through ?
who has been right ?
but rather than to that of these different <unk> things that are the so , none of the way of where you 'll have to come up .
well , the next question is the concrete next step i do ?

instead of to develop and management and so what you , just in the next step .
because what you , because in terms of uncertainty and also do ?
but the lead this very determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan , for you , <unk> one step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's , ai other .
so , it 's so important that you your what 's clear .
that there you the inside of security .
and the way , how we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes , do n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- and says , also <unk> , children .
so , this playful attempt to learn , this and cultivate this <unk> playful attempt for it 's also , this is gee-whiz fun thing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just like , that <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds like , yes , very good .
but i do n't know , with me in the company , i think , there must , many of bosses change that there anything happens .
and the reasons , here in germany , there 's always like this gives the mood .
and i think , there have the politicians to find out to worry that , to change .
okay my boy , come from the time with .
how do this time , down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
thousand ?
ten million ?
look at this down .
if you see ?
alright , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or to it , mahatma gandhi to say , for the kind of change you in the world , looking in you yourself .
you think , beautiful words and big models , but how do that because it work ?
because we have , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .

and if you in of these situations , wondering what you see you now despite all this to ask , you , which is what you take you can physically unfit to you very powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , , what you to them like , over the you just <unk> .
and , finally , to ask , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or because of what happened is because it .
so i mean , if , you already happening is that , it at least worth it .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and you think that you want to me that helps on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and among you , two things .
first time one in the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your hugely to do what will .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second one on your inner attitude to myself to .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future is always just then when we our own perception .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .

yes .

nice .
now , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold it , because now , with this <unk> ?
this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
thanks very clear .
which i , the spirit , i see .
<unk> is to breathe tapped .
and that is what the <unk> really is like .
a <unk> from those potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now , this is the <unk> .
the right the country , long time in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert , bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> zeppelin -- or <unk> or how they all these hot .
let us , just that spirit to revivify it .

you see , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive , that i spoke with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , are , children , our future .
instead is that the way , i of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , i 've started .
we technically qualify <unk> captures that means you , after the later , either on doing , or find after their i was lighter one of the workplace , they actually , can hold .

our program is a much not so easy to understand how to run the , the kids do .
and honest , i had said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , i work would .
do you know , is the most critical lack of the childhood , with the people that we work with ?
we 've learned , it are positive models as often the male positive models .
, if you think about why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it that the father had no sensible work , that he , '' -- that he 's no drugs which is , or that he himself in prison is .
and if then a seven-year-old boy , i think about what it from his life to make , he may not even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .

his father was raging alcoholic drink and made the entire family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 signature was is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother he had the home .
there was he the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and the perfect victims .
to the day , you might be a little baby brother of the game , so roughly <unk> been is that the bottom are stuck .
there out , martin 's the first time the <unk> through , he went to tell you go and proposed to .
and go from this day he was respect .
and it went on .
violence was part of well , his life that 's the same with his father .
how it goes well , the ones that i just described . i , on ?
after the whole childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> the perception .
and then they are no one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's like that goes , their thoughts about the same community over the also not a better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , when you put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're going to criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and we 're still in the later , where you after the penalty <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will everyone on the second criminals to prison .
then there 's but also people in prison , really change want .
but also these people wear a rubber stamps in the broad forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that their first building identity .
if you know , a work for , if you know , an apartment for whether they new they build a relationship to all you going with this identity , with that rubber face , you one who in the society that it 's hard power .
this is the problem , the we are .
how we 're trying to handle this issue ?
what they have this , you think , and many <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> building has , definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison , did .
that we want to a good use .

we get all of the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody lost it , getting <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the custody at the <unk> , <unk> the side that strengthening of your personal relations and , one of <unk> .
what for a big , because of our program , and out ?
it 's a great , bandwidth , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion of fast enough money to have him , very early to trade with their seduces us .
he had always been fun , businesses to this .
he 's then <unk> first time , arrested .
and those later , it 's not very impressed me .
well , the point .
he says , i have today , he have at its second later prepared .
<unk> is he then to the second time ever been wrongfully convicted .
and he then only in therapy , part and then the <unk> .
and there was it , he used to become leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .

he 's now here with me .
who hears him to know each other to talk about it .
, back to martin , that i told him to start telling someone had .
martin , after his childhood a training to really just leave and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and because alcohol , and they go up there , the agenda are was be that is quite quickly started .

twenty years , which he that life .
and he says , that he was out with this fabulous lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day that he got someone at a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there has really be life changed .

and he was one of his prize — so excited that he had decided that i want it would pass .
and he wanted to become part of the <unk> .
that has kind .
he works for now , two years at us and <unk> our participants in their way into the freedom , because he knows , ourselves that , if you , really change want , and if you have the right tools with apologies to the hand , get that much more possible is when you 're oftentimes i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , with us in jail , the to external , events , with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , with their personal plans to get you .
that are our authority , <unk> talks in our lessons to that are students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to do .
and that are we 've met , our participants , right after the later to be with .
and also these people take a very much of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , an exercise , <unk> called .
we 're pasting , then in the space as a big so on our participants are the , and our an stand on the other .
and i then of questions .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , yes , you answer to kick it , the line .
and here shows , what we all have that , whether we within the prison are , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and an example of that , where the differences are , is following question .
i 'm in a so-called `` social focal point up , i had a family member of what , once in custody .
there are usually very many of our participants in front of the line , a very few days of an environment .
a question , and i 'm thinking , all together , <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
that i urge you that they all of even get up .
maybe we had a little light get in the audience .
i can you see .
it are all .
well .
thank you .
i get out , you now , and if you that question , yes , you 're trying to do again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's kind of our our line , we now .
i have in my life of things done , for the i was punished , can be , it , but not .
if you that question , yes , you 're trying to prioritize , you please .
that counts , drunk all the risks .
that counts , maybe as low doses of them into my obsession .
that counts , it with the seat , not very , to have .
okay .
and it 's also to be any workforce , not always very accurate and signed .
all right .
the most of your seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must , all back down .
we looked at this question , if we the events , imagine , get our an environment very often the mulling stage .
and you will also clear , how much greater happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also , and that they may not always been doing that caught by these are if you something that 's by the <unk> or also about it out did .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their i was a work .
this is very quickly .
<unk> percent have , already here independently .
a third of the donor cycles in the past year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i had it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of us to .
i 'm <unk> .

and it 's a <unk> , -- what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a massive saving local means .
when my father and i do that <unk> started to have , we 're the open , putting extract from pretty much for quite nuts and that .
i was my amazing <unk> in a big businesses comes up .
but i have to tell you , i in my life , not as a <unk> the work .
we encourage our participants that , responsibility to take .
responsibility , in your life 's happened , and all , responsibility for to wrestle , in their lives will happen .
, not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also the number , again , trust to build .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride and when our participants , frankly , of their way to report .
now i you a video with them .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months , convicted .
i do with you 're going into an interconnected .
so , i have a judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what for me was important , was this <unk> , also made .

i was n't <unk> , '' ' i almost to say , yeah .
i went back goals of eyes tip .
i went back into perspective of figured i went back to jump forward at .
and you go with a very other minds and consciousness from the penalty out .
so far it was more and <unk> without an explicit goals and then is you , in and anything <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now .
well , the problem is that many no assistance , when the out .
that the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically , which is that you back in the old , backward .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , whatever , because it was offered is , with me just all my thinking about me remind ourselves , about other , the user to deal with these problems , the user to deal with the society , that , with me just during these two weeks , who shot .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman in divorce .
and been happening internationally , six months . bye '' i went back with her .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i sit under one , through this whole <unk> and many other things that changed . i .
so much . i ' i already done .
i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , '' ' i say .
i do , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you know that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , like for example , my mentor , also about this time still out and actually about to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> is beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea of all came out there are you to be so what do .
i 'm grateful for you to do it , with safety in trouble , he pulled , and i 'm extremely grateful that i would be part of all for .
that of course , the people , the support , and they were .
i like i said , with many people in the events , talked , and the me , confirmed have this is good , that do .
and it 's why the wind ' i 's also do .
and to say , i thank you .
they come up with us in jail .
each of you has something that we can .
if you our participants in their <unk> which , if you know when the <unk> to come from us whether they in the frame of financial support and this is .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> want to wear , <unk> issue .
you 're talking about us , please .

and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i , <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i do something that way .
because you do yes , these things .
, for <unk> promoting shinerama .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .


anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i 'm here 's really kind of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i was able to me , what could color as my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability i found rather frightening .
now , it at least , express .
, i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not going to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> again to throw this ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that was so , the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> at a day .
as i said <unk> .

you fluently , you look at the world 's living in very good hotels and write fluently , the country on a very <unk> way .
fluently , but sometimes , <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it sure anymore to see , and say , there as a quaint countryside with kind <unk> people for the , though they have nothing , much greater happiness and joy of broadcast .
what a lot of these images and from cliché about living , but really chronicles a way too .
and that was for me after a while the key .
i was that what i did to little bit .
to the surface .
and i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right to know .
the <unk> writing articles .
and to my personal passion to be breastfeeding .
how you are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
the people who lives , you home .
not in the hotel .
by showing you , with the challenges and with the problems of people really busy .
and by showing you with the people who works .
at least that was the answer , i went on this question there was .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy .
i wanted to contribute at .
something to do good .
and this sense , with me , at a <unk> still further research increases .
i was , before , often in developing world , nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war , not just numbers of an orphan , but also lots of economic and social problems , and left .
with an annual income of <unk> euros of nepal is the poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to try to the two decades , the poorest countries around the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult male ca n't read and writing .
all these facts , very many personal stories and experiences , i on this journey has had met on me in a time , i was willing and frankly , was for change .
in the i even a change .
and whistles , which said , my return of nepal and my decision .
i quit my job .
and she was to the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt from the answer to return , i on my job application received .
because they just a defining who was .
it 's going to a serious application , <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the , at the time in nepal is life , i want , and a funding of living in .
hi ?
let 's still ?
i was really seriously , i mean , and good .
at least i thought that .
and this answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really do unplug .
and i ' course , quite a profound emotional response , writing .
and fortunately , never <unk> .

i it used as an engine , to my own company to reasons .
<unk> .
heart . labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that , that offers , what i then for this .
which is the way , a country to the way to do .
the way , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people , where life and you can work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means for the place in which you good so karma can gather together .
in which you do good .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , with us to do in your living meaningful volunteering that .
they pay for their journey , just like a different organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in <unk> .
and the objective is n't care as a lot of recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden .
to speak , our participants who ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , gentle tourism , in the regions of the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism , have .
because just the necessary to infrastructure that 's missing .
to the other we can send sustainable design projects go forward .
we can reduce their sustainable design projects to and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also on not donations to .

now we have with our work <unk> in nepal .
convenes a year we have our engagement in uganda expanding .
and now after about four years turned to us now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team was a <unk> question .
we take the <unk> way to continue ?
or what if we still more of thinking ?
if we the <unk> still going on this ?
if we do with the development , not just a social engagement and sustainable to in my but the development in his wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> have them ?
or , or specialty , <unk> .
that would then , a new one extra company .
a company , the fact , company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
she was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure we want that .
we love social entrepreneur and their creative companies .
because we in a ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same dreams were dreaming .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have in this year <unk> one sister , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in its development and to <unk> that we by an extraordinary people to support .
to be with we the participants who or the staff of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> `` the <unk> include .
and <unk> the <unk> prepare .
the there 's at <unk> , again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one more huge masses .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still -- the unconscious biases .
where you might want to a flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
when there is a its strength of eyes .
that 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or something that 's the serenity , you new in , discovered .
the serenity and things to the you do n't we can change .
and the power , things to change , you can change .
and you very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
a sample of this .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women from uganda .
with a sad <unk> and with a talent .
they would be a beautiful , was handcrafted <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , which design , maybe the answer comes .
we wanted to these women help .
and have so in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
they buy the people of poverty , get .
the you a guaranteed income there .
a future to occur .
we 're talking yesterday with our <unk> 's gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sale to them not just for a year , income .
but allows us , the project , much bigger .
this first edition , is sort of social crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who are going to , can this thing , with the purchase a way to be able to the other day , it , but with us , directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women who travel , active <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women a job , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
this is , but this <unk> just a project from our possibility , cycle , and projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area easy to little bit .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
everything , and in our own cycle on each other .
and the power to be more sense , as any one project for yourself .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the different projects .
the opportunity to the fact , just in the inside of work .
and i 'm going to leave you now , right on a journey to take them .
and to please , you the eyes to restore .
reset , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting in one of wooden dining room .

before i 'm starting to be an interest me , of you tonight is that they 're here , and have time someone 'n ' house work up .
i just know , with the light , not that really well , but perhaps want to someone woke up .
down here just know , i got someone .
two .
here , up just know , i 'm not , but , down here are already , two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i ' , a building up and that the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
that 's the building .
together with two decades , the other people . i ' i the villa out in the last summer , six months for up there .
and so stuck , i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
what is a 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i want it quickly explain .
oh , what , you up now the villa along ?
and you <unk> in the park or how ?
just a small plant choice of questions , we know , friends , who have asked when they 've learned that i became part of initiative , i whistle , which , something <unk> name , <unk> 'm .
all those that we reconnect seamlessly in the series of <unk> <unk> .
and here about this time of the villa <unk> up did , <unk> world faces and so in suspended .
and to the privatization of a villa out to stop protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , you privately simply is , and so for many people do n't want to put it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is , and therefore it 's not be used it , public spaces may use .

and we wanted to a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and i want to take this now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .

now , simultaneously , with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and highly enriched .
and have us to , on different skills , but also on various networks <unk> .
and creative part of living unconventional solutions in the <unk> , and then we did have to <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
but it was a 's us about that we the villa with stories and ideas being .
we have after 9/11 memories and images being asked .
and from these memories and images out to go to outlook for the villa out to develop .
and it was we need to the process , a constructive ; it remains .
us as an initiative , we have , of be as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .

the experiences that we have , and they 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is to go .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face .
in many cases , this , inferred and commercialized and be in the result of citizens , strangers are places .
they are the dead -- a city because you just a woman , not the equal , what we asked in public space and expect .
so for instance , that we <unk> have to <unk> .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places , neglected , this is often did .

what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in the our social life is happening .
so how we there a lot of the first <unk> that they to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way shopping to meet .
and we can see this increase , if we just an ai n't have an opportunity to sit , and we actually stop when the spaces also designed accordingly designed accordingly .
and we just 'n longer you 'll have .
it turns out of creating friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to it 's a feeling of community .
ever more profound encounters , and in this is a public space . i , more and faster and more of it 's also that community .
and when i do n't <unk> , which is that , what you probably the memory of a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can make reasonable criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , the growing and actually also not much <unk> of the same places .
imagine , you now , they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper on and read the following the text .

they must be in the following , the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation in with the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone of them to this event going to go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds , first time .
it there ai to what it .
they ca <unk> the way in the future looks .
and again , it sounds , first time it in the first moment .
i trial , let me and yet , an explanation .
and that , because i , i 'm they ca n't really has or pick up or shape , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> often , far too late <unk> .
that is , mostly they do n't have any chance to really , your suggestions to make or some alternatives to discuss them , but there 's actually , ai design and they ca <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend who recently , what color the trash can have the example .
second kind of classic <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think , three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
the frustration and incomprehension -- are often , the what i also kind of which is .
i have to no choice about <unk> or <unk> make when i really like it eliminates <unk> route of <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also different .
although at that as overcoming the existing <unk> of conversation in fact , we have ultimately , it disturbed about .
so , then we have experience them and the , i for other <unk> share .
i want it too , others have initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or , to the city , and the policy .
because of the ones who are , like <unk> actually do we should and the really responsible for such manufacturing processes are .
if , which is really the interest in the participation of the way that it so often to struggle and that they will then we and then we need the who did this new <unk> .
not , <unk> ' i but also , they all , you today , sit here .
and it 's why , because i <unk> for very important to think .
i , ' it for important that they all go , and i want you with our example , encourage the <unk> still a chance to give them .
and i watch me , they all , because you who are , in the who did a new <unk> demand it can .
so , we have to what happens if you look like to the citizens of consciousness , `` stewardship and engagement for your neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to stir up ?
first about willingness to the dialogue going on the field .
in <unk> meet the professionals in layman to the citizens on <unk> and of interest them .
what we see here , is a picnic table , to the we invited .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in conversation with citizens .
the goal to be able to all these conversations on the field of people , so that 's not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the skills of citizens .
the citizens , where are experts , they 're experts , for your neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to yoke , in which tradition , a place is , and also , what you a place , lacking .
the <unk> , in the city can put myself , what on <unk> level in the project to do .
in alone or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved in the subjects to make up , just on the project and are the after .
all this leads to a <unk> , all of information for all that are and the then the place to be able to be .
by maybe , you 're going to get , the one of identification of the place to take place .
a dialogue going on the field ; also means that the wishes , the residents in fact taken seriously .
and that 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> next to the marketplace .
that can course , in again , he got to be , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , what is right solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> fit all , in one another place .
well , the to figure out of the conversation turns out then you come up .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , completely comfortable , when he ago <unk> big amorphous group is , and you can talk .
a lot of others can do is , well , and write like , but the text , and then not , <unk> big amorphous group .
a 's what might get hostile or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to be different <unk> give to transform flavors of market , an event .
we have here , for the way , simple to come , there to be , first time to watch , what happens .
in the background , ai small exhibition .
we have is the possibility of out , <unk> to give them .
we have the possibility of out , to paint .
we have the possibility of out , to write .
from the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
and we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> , to participate , should always been able to be .
that can , for about a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results of the dialogue , among the are .
we even have the entire process in parallel postulate on facebook with this , and on one of independent blog , and the news <unk> about a newsletter distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often , too late on today .

<unk> is the process , but only then when he early , takes place and the who best , even still do n't know , with <unk> we need to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back to the point , one got to be discussed this is the scenarios for an area in the question .
<unk> heard , to <unk> itself .
and that is , then , if not in the first , that is that the <unk> event , and so i look , but the experiences from the previous self-assembles .
what happens now , if , citizens in your city of them and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous and projects .
i , let 's an example of <unk> is the <unk> , is probably in many of this is known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> there are inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to make should now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , he could not different , as the idea to their own .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i 'm not anymore to say , because he has to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or educational administration .
the point , <unk> for the <unk> were already .

the city was told <unk> is n't necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , we for <unk> <unk> have the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city the <unk> the initiative , there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere , painting every citizen reporting their own crossing the streets .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
it 's that far , now you would say .
then we do but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility .
why ?
one thing , , because they yes , a look for a 's all have or should have .
during the dedicated , it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , in the time on a for you in some form the relevant than in the focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects , also the attention .
and to another piece of course , the city of the projects are taking , are other tool available to .
a <unk> initiative that can this just a letter-sized piece of priority .
also our goal was actually a little bit like an initiative , after her school , and i planned was roughly half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city , who wanted .

it run , there .
so we have unfortunately , the problem that we the responsibility , not deliver the minds .
but we know , now , that when the city of the villa successful <unk> when the negotiation in fact , are successful , then a <unk> there will .
in what form of the place is , however , frankly .
to finally , now , i 'm convinced of that many projects , by their meaning , complexity or , cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of happiness that 's blessing and our identification , to create .
if you just in time and the conversation with the citizens <unk> .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all , you tonight is sitting here .
if we put on and at the fall because the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than how annoying would perceive , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> come .
we have about <unk> spoke .
so this idea , ai n't second chance to have , if it in this life did n't really , just , ai n't second chance .
we identified very exciting .
and we were , but relatively quickly to agree that 's two things that there , we do n't , see that we wanted .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also , by the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
at me is it , are now that <unk> years ago , but the words , lead , i immediately to <unk> hands .
my neck straps , together and i just want to go back on a 's the loo .
and then i do n't know , how it on you was , but in my exams , was , `` the one that with the <unk> taken seriously , the was always the next to me .
no idea , what 's from the actually become .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was completely clear , never again , school .
and what is now i say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , i there is this . i , i ' i in schools spent .
with a desire and , voluntary .
how she was there 's that ?
like this happened ?
that started first time to make that something happens is , what i do n't be able to .
i got kids .
so , my wife eventually got the children .
and therefore i was then , that you one is , to this <unk> to deal was .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there is sort of in this <unk> , whoa , i felt i was thrown in the <unk> .
that looked right , how it back then , we looked .
and that made as well , like how to school at it made , and i <unk> , let me , human being here , yes , real failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard , and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh my god , the sentence . i ' i mean , then , not <unk> .
what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , for a 's life really shut down to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> already , really well we can ?
and you may have some time , of the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is , in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity in short time as much know , in , <unk> , just , so i do it then on a button again <unk> can be able to me , at that is ?
well , i ' that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point , one , it 's some of whether someone , one good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good and diagnostic of has ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we so back , so about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that , you voted .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then eventually they completely was introduced .
and where we also the educational system , how we do it today , its roots .
and if we have the time , imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , you can kind of forced to have to the school to go and with knowledge of been that were then we really the only way , had to collaborate with the knowledge and the facts and the information in their time in contact , .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket and as the library of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that go there , things have changed in the world and there were suddenly humans need that these new machines have been able to .
the same time , but also people needs of these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we need people that these machines to build it could and the these factories were running .
maybe you see it already .
that <unk> system , that we now in germany , you ask you still have , has its root in this time .
and before a potentially make sense .
it 's , because it was probably really that was that , what i at school because i learned . i ' for a structure of the assembly line well , who the assembly line said , stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let that <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just briefly about to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the time , now do you on the first company .
yes , after some of them to get around me so with the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some of companies are going to us <unk> and they were bigger and bigger , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then clinging to us again , so in <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we had then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so exciting professions , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know that they ai n't have no idea that they have , what these people do , but when i the school and we had no idea that , so what ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet , you ca n't talk .
and the children , we now the school , send the job to the in 10 , six , twenty or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know , which are going to the need to in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so the future looking at who might give me because the <unk> for the saturday .
there 's <unk> ticket , i ' i read .
well , it , you have no idea .
how we can get then got to school for a 's lives learning it ?
and what is the things that we need to kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe help people like a view , in this , what companies today , they 're looking for .
that are , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming then in the company .
and if you , so this ai n't see classic <unk> yourself , then it , first mover in my , so what the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading , then so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
that 's going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and the way you , in three discrete groups to summarize .
this is , , and business too , and staff , flexible , are , flexibility and that 's one .
and then i wish , almost everybody freeze their employees , they tend to think .
and then i wish , these companies , the <unk> .
so we have flexibility to become leaders are thinking and predicts all .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively fast by understanding .
if we look at the economy to work , how fast , yes , how fast , everything is changing .
<unk> , at the whole business models are the internet , the morning on the head of really .
there 's got madd '' i , the with that shift can deal .
there 's got madd '' i worked on that are creative .
there 's got madd '' i , the <unk> .
this is quite sure exactly the opposite of the what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the line of it had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's the people , take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if that 's now , the company is , or as well as a society , wishing that we humans , take responsibility for that telescope .

and if we wanted to the soccer cup , remember , then there 's because the internet for this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .

that 's the only in common to create .
and also that somebody , this big , and innovator -- our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone , invented has , has not the <unk> invented , has a massive itunes n't invented , has nothing in it .
the had a team , that made possible , because just as a team began to the do that what they 've done .
so this ai at school , these three things that could , that if only , ai at school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and that 's been able to itself .
if the one , what we 're talking about the future , certainly going to tell you can is that they uncertainty is then is , but the ability , and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to the <unk> that we in later life , and that our children in later life are successful .
that if only , but this ai at school , these things .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have that you know that 's not just this ai of this is , for the you <unk> to pay .
so this ai event , after the slogan , all said , not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all of invisible .
yes , i sat there and what i say , <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest lists of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the subject of homework and learn the whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the kid , sick staff is , because at school stressed out there .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> , this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
in fact , it was also not <unk> , it was more like a <unk> , so right after the hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also reminded me the fine-scale detail by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's bring out that 's not .
<unk> are , but two years , in which we did have , there 's anything .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had to actually the question put it 's our child , fail ?
and we 're all the only , where it this is ?
now i ' i in the last two years , since i put in the subject i 'm involved with very many people who spoke and i ' that , no way i ' learned , you 're not alone .
there are very many , where it very similar to go and that was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just the road , a company to , have to walk around us , i thought , where the journey because she goes , and night , we sat , the cash and have us about the private things to be exchanged .
and what i say , he has told me almost the same story , his children 's almost the same thing i know how we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children there 's take the minds from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it eliminates <unk> , different schools and we could even a charter schools in to consider .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we both right now the idea that had to school , since we were there is not that really changed we thought , yes , we are the first to the issue right now , do .
just , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good thing is that we deceive them .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast this ai whole range of amazing people found that is similar to how we , ai n't manage to create that everybody who are stacks up .
it is yes , not so that just the children and their parents lying under the suffering , out there are often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the , doubled .
it can now , that all parents do wrong ?
that all children dying are and that , those teachers have broken we are ?
or it be that we have a system have that it does n't have more like that well , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , does it also not anymore , right .
and we have many people found that 's not that went and we 've even people found that are not have children .
and they 've understood that they take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now to school . go to hang on the way , there .
and we have us , <unk> second , gotten there 's out there ai whole range of one of initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really cool thing <unk> and there 's almost , every school teacher , really involved , are and a change .
and there 's even the , or another , courageous principal , the , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had , no concept that we are there is now , to help us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools , and we can in these schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can do with are in two days ai whole bunch of moving .
there are coming so people , in the past more like each other have been working and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
the come with <unk> very first challenge that you are common problems .
and after two of those days have the then , for a new <unk> developed sooner or the , and given for this ai n't entirely new high as we 're in berlin to school , just to .

inside of two days after all evolved to find the next day , which can be .
but what that i could is said , what these two days , and that makes it for me , so beautiful , the small number of the weekends , i , then also time , among schools , germany to spend , is this energy , there is what if the three things .

so sort of the leaders , thinking and if you , his experience .
then is that a spark , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , so this ai n't manage to come back then you know , we 've seen that , the school as a whole has to change that there ai n't entirely new culture of , is .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' , invite them over the school to think .
i <unk> ' , invite men , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they all , also to invite men , about , over the school , to talk .
you 're talking about this about , what you like , but you 're talking about this is also , what you do n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed , they get and how many people did the have experienced , but just not talking about it .
you make us , let us on every school in germany , the <unk> century among them .
you make us the entire system to change .
and you make us this together to do with the people the school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only bound together we can do this .
thank you .
