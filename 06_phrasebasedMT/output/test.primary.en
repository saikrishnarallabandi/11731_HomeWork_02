when steve lopez , funny , you 're going to los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of going to los angeles listening to , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , notoriously rough , are homeless , on a violin , playing the only still two strings , had .
a lot of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , of this movie was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> school , and of very promising was tragically the early by his paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or , the film at , so they 're not just the wonderful place where we understand the difference between these two men that is , but also the music that make it and how they finally the instrument was , if this off the light is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
i 've <unk> in the years since 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .




as a result of it 's now , especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages . the 're sometimes it gets so , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , this horror and the <unk> his own mind 's exposed .
and in just as a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first started , walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this is how the flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and about how to him , someone in their sleep and poison .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i saw him lose that that it in a bit of the conditions , get it could and that i was to its relationship to a violin , that could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and another very exciting prospect of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy , to play .

and while i was playing , i noticed on that in <unk> eyes a full of years ago , went .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible have said , a chemical response , of the catalyst of my game .
<unk> <unk> rage and turning , understanding , in a steady of curiosity and such unbending grace .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .

and i was clear that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with her , one of personal relationship there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that i would just one of my colleagues in the philharmonic , we go to los angeles to know .

music is medicine . music , changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions , help his imagination and creativity in a real to aspire .
and so <unk> it , who situation .
i realized that 's what is the essence of art .
what this is the reason , why we need to do : so we do something that in all of us , in the inside of us is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually made shapes gone .
and the fact that expression , all of us , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .

the <unk> power of music got it back in a family of musicians , it 's mind , to be a talent and realized , and it raised hands .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me , why i brought musicians have 'm .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope that you pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i just two very loved .

it was a fish , <unk> , good it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the the highest standards of sustainability , seeing .
you could , so i feel about that , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i in an event , which might think about the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , the ability to trying to this incredible this problem for us chefs 's become . how do we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean more fish out how we forests <unk> beaten up .

90 percent of the big fish , that we love of tuna that <unk> , <unk> , this swordfish , they 're totally collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so is , or something <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .

not very strongly .
and tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , trying to it right .
i wanted you support .

we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` just with the facts , right to have you are famous for , so far out in the sea , to grow to her the environment , not really polluted water . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out the waste of our fish you will , not quite concentrated . ''
and then put it 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she handed her ? ''
`` how sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great , '' i said , put on .
and , that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein that ?
so i the next day , briefly , the event , don brownlee , .
i said , don brownlee , for instance , are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
he said , he had her not . he 'll and of .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a this answer , until i finally , senior fellow biologists on .
we call him , don .
`` well , don brownlee , '' i said , `` what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , putting feathers to the skin , <unk> , but , <unk> and to forage process . ''
i said , `` how much percent have consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don brownlee , what is that chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a recess during the line and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken , the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 'm .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear , god , the fish , sort of entertainment , chicken , tasted star .
this second fish , that 's another kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , you , ever better if you his fish even know , learns , you the fish , the more love .
i told him , first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .

you think that has kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef dan had him <unk> .
, twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish so well , tasted the after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy put it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he says jose miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist , <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> the river <unk> .
to the thing i was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> the height , what , the wetlands .
they did that , by , the country <unk> .
they built this to a result of sewers , and they had urged her water from the country , and out into the river .
now , they could n't make that was fine , not forwards economically .
and ecologically and it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds to , for this place , many birds are .
and so , in a spanish company with green the country .
what they 've done ?
they have the river in the water , and vice versa .
they 've literally the lever <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> they the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they 've never seen anything like that .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and this dense , abundant march .
i was there , not too long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's a really incredible guy , three parts by charles darwin and a part , `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were and she fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on to my travels at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here you can take it 's a rare <unk> .
now i said he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here he look like a pattern of labor pool , that it , <unk> giraffe , it .
it turns out , that is miguel of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , he beelines , like a <unk> 's become .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then it and sudden plummets , more maybe of those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .

it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece here 's a fish that i the brink of had .
so i put him , broken . i said , `` miguel , but it comes to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed up with the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what we eat your built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , it continues to me to share that it 's a rich system is that the fishes better food , in the wild , would .
the more vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish , she feeds .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
and space of a farm heard that they are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , is miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , seems to be , '' different than any rural farm , the i ever been was , `` how much it , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we must bow on the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet and so far the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to their bellies on earth , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
yes , he said .
`` we 're losing $ 20 percent of our fish and <unk> , the birds .
now the last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going , his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker looks so the belly and more than the system . ''
okay , so let that has come . a farm , they are not an and a farm , their success , the health services to predators , it .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos , of the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city are 240 miles away , where the evaporated and better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly you are 240 miles to farm .
and every night , fly you are 240 miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a trip across the penguins had imagined , so looking at that i miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly , they are 240 miles to the farm and fly you are 240 miles back on the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked at me , when i just a song of the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i do n't have the skin of my beloved of the fish , the most delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i like they do n't be crisp , .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i do you in this restaurant in <unk> one of have , they do n't even after <unk> tasted star .
they did sweet and in the thing , as if you a half bites the ocean , would .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a swam .
you is the last caginess , until something in the body to entry into .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then put it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish do n't an . a farm , their success is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , if he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water , that through this farm is coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , of rivers , that we tend to you , to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it spreading through the system , fighting , and this , it 's the waters clean , how it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , they are not an , not just a farm , their success , the health services to predators , it , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for these fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to take him , and that they should also do , because these year-old , like this was anything that , is also telling .
you could tell you to a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , and taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .

we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat will be organic .
and if they claim that there are the future of good food can assure everybody 's somebody somewhere and says , `` hey , people , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .


now , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of what would be .
feed the grain , <unk> , <unk> , you know monocultures , chemicals , the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and the sort of the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful can it be ? ''
that was the motivation . it was the , which . it was the plan , the american agriculture .
we should they call , is , if you in <unk> , if you really , that fast , who end of its , and that this production to take place .
this is not if you really , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through the fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not by a chainsaw , but through the forests , and not by were doing and nets , but by the fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
you make us to start with the question : how we 're going to feed itself ?
or better , the conditions do that every community to enable themselves , to feed ?
so to do this , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has never heard something really good for food produced .
we look , the ecological systems model .

you look , is miguel , farmers like miguel ,
businesses , not worlds for , are , businesses , where instead <unk> , businesses , <unk> growing some rather than just hard to farmers , not just emitters of these are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are the ones who also hired experts to flavor .
and if i really be honest , i 'm sure you 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
so you know that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , it will just delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one thing with want it 's the totality of the data , we consume , greater is as the sum of the parts and instead of it , <unk> to think , i want you to think about how we information that can use that , patterns start to and that we actually realize that otherwise would n't have been visible , be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age of these .
this program , that i 'm running here , is a little experiment .
it 's called <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do is , after a certain death will filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that , it .

we can one step further out and make the data , new , and see that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects out there are , but not for everyone .
if we now go and after the age , number , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that are accidents , even the cause is about the , the people have to start thinking .
and who <unk> see that is especially in men 's true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way , to swim in a living <unk> it .
and if we do this for raw data can make , why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the front covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' that ever in print .
it 's all . it 's everything online .
you can it would like to my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can just in a decade .
you can just in a particular year .
you can go directly to of a copy one .
now if i look over here , i see the athletes , in this copy them out and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong 's a fan , so i click go into , all tell me to show in which have lance armstrong and i will .
now , when i just a <unk> so people get to , i could think , `` ok , what if i do anything with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i walk a step back and <unk> the way .
now i 'll be greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you this information on , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do is something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way as information can be .
i want this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazed .
what here we 've done is , we have any one <unk> and you on a little summary of boils down .
the summary of a short , often , and a symbol for the area of that they come .
i 'm just , the top , in the popular <unk> .
but even in this unconstrained view , we can get lots of things do .
immediately , we get a sense of the themes that focuses on wikipedia , the popular .
so i 'm the issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' one of have you know what i feel that the <unk> , the most so , `` time magazine , `` people the year , '' .
this is really important , there is an insight is that 's not in a single <unk> that .
this is just to see if you a step back and the entire at .
overlooking on a certain type of <unk> i can then in the subject of the time magazine , `` people the year , '' in to go , and all together .
now if i say these people consider you know what i feel that the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we 're surfing on the net the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but much more abstractly .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser , call it ; it 's really not a browser , but you can do web to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .

that 's why most important , because you just by that look at the web in these kinds of the way , all the <unk> the same way , and the way at it .
so i can in my ted stage to zoom in a certain time .
here is the entire demonstration , i returned to go on this .
and i can , everything that i now been considered to have to go back .
and when i went back a step <unk> and on all look , can i mean by the new way , maybe , after my <unk> . here , i have to <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live on the labs <unk> .
and of this is , i in the side of the inside and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , and it 's used , and every time , it does this picture than the sum of pieces .
the moment in the world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk from the cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` from drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , from one to the other to go to start of many things to many things go to , and it creates pattern of see , which is this actually stayed still be ?
if we do this can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it to get .
and if we know what appears to then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep in me sitting , this voracious , curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that , at that i always , when i do n't look at school was , by the forests <unk> , around and `` 25,000 samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and every now , and <unk> , everything , looking at home to paint and under the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction conventions like , in my picture , since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were exploring the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing . shows that we animals and places and a whole world of miracle that showed that we 'd never looked like you can imagine .
that has then , very good to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , these <unk> with computer-generated performance of movies , the imagery in the media , i had to the images in my head of activities .
that we had at all . if we as children 's a book read , we took the description of the author and projected that they 're at the screen in our minds .
my response that was the drawing and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , humble technology and all so what .
in class , i was always the teachers get it , i , below the textbook was hidden , <unk> .
the creativity to , somehow figure out .
and what happened , a funny . what makes me , which , frere jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea , one of us , unfamiliar world here on our earth itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spaceship . that it struck me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i actually enter it could , here on earth , and she was also fascinating and very exotic as all that , that i 've always imagined was , when i these books had read .
so i decided to when i was 15 , scuba divers , to be .
the only problem that was that i was in a small village in canada , living , one over 12,000 miles away from the ocean away .
it was that i do n't <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he finally one <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , the participants did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i got only two years later to face , when we , california to flat .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i spent about three of hours , under water is this . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i have learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature knows , no borders , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to any kind of days i feel that i then the awe , that , what i have on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as an adult encountering a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
that appeared to the best way , my inner drive , stories to share with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a kid was doing this , i always in comic books and so .

of course , the stories i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
, `` <unk> '' i was my penchant for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> connect .
so intertwined , of my two passions .

what , it ends up was the computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
and the film . and it 's no money , just said he is playing right time , by a , but i realized something fascinating , the audience around the world was like to be mesmerized by the magic , it was initiated .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know , <unk> technology and magic does n't even more people have evolved to tell them .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i said , `` wow this must have in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , '' , my next movie , much more .
together with <unk> created we there , the guy of liquid metal . the success were very mainspring of them , like this effect to be .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity , <unk> .
so i was a company , along with my good friend with stan winston , to speak at the best <unk> and <unk> . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''

that we did , and wildlife that a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s , i realized we , we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects , new heights , it should , realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> there were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff , and the people in my company told me that we <unk> still not in the ability to be , that to create .
so then shifted , and made this is another movie about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> distilled <unk> , a film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually , real ants cover up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
it 's why i have the movie .
that 's the truth . that we knew that , but not .
i mean , but i convinced , by i said , `` we come to the cover up . we shoot the actual up .
we will it in the <unk> the movie .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that the own imagination a reality we do it .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the atlantic , and i think about the real titanic , through a <unk> at .
this was not a film , not definition , that was real .
so , that has really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had to give cameras and a spotlight , and all sorts of building .
and i fell on the very these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you ascend back in that cramped capsule , it you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope to saving is , it does n't even back to do .
and i said , `` wow , that 's also , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was it became obsessed with the study the deep ocean .
anyway , the future of this that with curiosity and science to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , me to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a being able to do for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't tell me that to imagine what i was outside the window would see .
some , the following expeditions i being in <unk> , and sometimes these things that i still never seen before i had , sometimes , things that all , nobody ever seen before , and for the science to the time , when we do you saw , actually , no words that had found .
that , i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i then a something unusual decision .
and after the success of `` titanic '' , i told , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood goes on ice on and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''

we returned to cover up the titanic transition back .
we took a little robots that we built were , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , the inside the ship at , what you 've never did was .
nobody had ever the inside <unk> demands . you had still not for another . so we have developed the will technology .
well , and there sitting i mean , the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , this <unk> 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there .
and i was with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i so if it 's just really , but my mind is within the of roving .
it felt , i would have a little exercise within the <unk> the titanic , and there .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> , i 've ever experienced this . because before i each to a corner on , i 've always been , in the <unk> of roving that you would , because i conducted months about <unk> did was , when we the movie on .
this is set was , which is an exact replica of plans , the ship .
so that was a very strange .
they made me this <unk> that you have such <unk> avatars and use and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence where there .
it was actually incredibly profound
and may also a brief reference , that , maybe in a few decades , could happen , if you <unk> has to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate , to learn , for instance , these <unk> , where we these amazing how they saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in the sunlight , but the system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 different degrees say that they survive there .
the same time so i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

that was fascinating .
but the end , it was that out that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took you , and <unk> you access to the world upside down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , for such extreme conditions were . i took you to the sources , so , you look around , so , and instruments in testing the minds and so forth .
we turned on a documentary films , run , but actually , science , more specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock , the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , then , as a kid , and the globe in the reality .
in over these landscapes as i have a lot of learned .
i 've got a lot about science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director and also has to lead , a leader , as a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because , a particular point i had to tell me , `` what i actually here ?
why i doing that ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking movies migrate to us no money .
we play time now , by a . of fame , not a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and have to me some of nails -- on a towel that the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , this in documentary , for a very audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what you doing just ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you 're doing it the <unk> because , and it 's because of funny connection , which is , if a small group of people have a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , many years , non-stop 've been . sometimes we were to two , three months in the lake .
and in this community makes you realize that the most important thing the warning — is that you , each other , because you a task does , that you any other things can explain .
if you to land back , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , <unk> , and the very precise idea , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on the lake has been working , '' and then you can the other just do n't explain . this is the police or at the soldiers , something together we have gone through and you know that they do it never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , prevents them .
when i so back to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same attends to run , which is that you can be a respected , in return to respect to merit .
it was the dynamics really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we were about `` computational avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to , family .
it changed , my kind of films to do , completely .

for me it was more a <unk> kind of my job to do , the actual process , the , in the result has changed .
so what can we from all of that ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at the first mover in this is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality we do it .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , say , they give me a benign advice , like that can do . ''
and i 'm saying , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that they put them , others for you . do n't it to myself , she 'll not against . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail as an alternative , because there , guarantees that 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at , ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on , .
that 's the idea , i them to talk on the way to give you want . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to them about energy and climate .
and that i 've just maybe something that , because my <unk> the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is , the things that we reinvent ourselves , and they have to the poorest two billion a better life to sustain .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years n't grow up . it we need to a lot sooner or to a rain . the things are , that change , it 's on their fragile environment is not withstand more you .
and that <unk> . it leads to handle uncertainty . it leads to food riots .
so , is a climate change in fact , they 're going .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just from one , the price down could , to <unk> would energy in near the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> towards the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators that painless climate , we can fully modern materials to make and so many things do .
so we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- we let us the price in case -- we meet in a roadblock , and this barrier on with carbon .
co2 fed up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , this is a result , the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to shift can and so a whole systems to come together .
now , the exact number of connection between a <unk> and the front of the centrality <unk> and where the spawning more drastic consequences are , there 's some of them , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about how to get those consequences will . but they are extremely they ca n't be .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we have to really shut down to close to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come to the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a fully three feet high office truck , under a $ 3 feet a bridge from . the then you can basically , from them down .
this must , after the bottom , on a zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average are 's about five million tons for each one on the planet .
and somehow we have to change that it on a zero .
it 's been consistently as up .
just different economic potential to have it 's shoulders and we need to of <unk> in order to reduction , and to a reduction to zero .
this equation , four factors . a basic multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- that they 're moving towards zero to break , and this is the number of people depend , the service , every person in the average use , the average of energy for every human services and the co2 , that per unit of energy <unk> will .
you make us so every single factor of them and look carefully , we how we do that the next to get .
likely to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it , through .
so we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is happening on 9 billion to . the , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i was going to 10 percent returned to 15 percent mortality down , but at the time we see a slippery slope to 1.3 .
the second piece of these are the services , we use .
that includes all the food , we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's amazing that number drops .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could n't think <unk> do and less use , but the average will be expecting that every year go up , so , in more than double , the number of services , per person to be provided by .
here we see a very basic services . there 's , light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have it 's not , so what they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever worked under the <unk> .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy needed some of those services , let me , to 90 percent to happen .
in other vital service , like the making of <unk> , is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> the scope for improvement is very much smaller .
overall , if we make these are , we might be a reduction , to a factor of the three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion dollars on it may <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that just not from .
we look so the fourth factor , -- and this is a , in be -- that 's a lot of co2 , per unit of energy <unk> will .
it , the question is whether you that the next to get it .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , except that renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we 're on a global level of them to create , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor inside is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of wonder contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a date , needs .
normally what you can kind of just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case , we need to but you floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration , the idea of people here with ?
i think back to the last year , when i mosquitos to somehow , they liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that , people there , with these life .
for energy , i noticed that 's a .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to the environment would be here .
so here are a couple of natural or fireflies .
this , me that you to do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't time that glass of .
now , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or of the an incredible this scale and how incredible dependability . and although it many ways , there , in which people do , we 're , i really just five , these big needs can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
this afford to be a ; on the contributions and if you better to do when i expect to be the great , but i mean the core here is that we 're going to all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they have to imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either way coal or gas .
what you there are going to , it may simply , but that 's not . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of the and comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them , and hope that , there 's left .
there 's some well , that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get it 's very difficult to be . and a way for the storage of co2 to make , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who would have to make sure ?
who can do something you need to literally hours a billion times bigger than any kind of waste , you , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
that 's a lot of volume .

the next thing : my rocketry that .
the also has three big problems . the cost , all , in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that nothing wrong can go , despite the human organization that the fuel not for weapons that 's used .
and so , what do you with the waste handled ?
because even though he did n't it 's very large , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable are , and , which you to work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized why .
it are those renewables , often be called .
and also the have -- although it is that they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .

that are <unk> , you talk about of you <unk> , times more land area as a normal power .

the sun does n't seem to all day , they seem , not every day and it blows , the wind and not the time .
so you must have , if you kind of these vents 's dependent on , a way to have the energy , in times when they do n't available there is , to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we for example , say that energy source of the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around the solar energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the way to show , i 've all kinds of us batteries , there are , at , for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of an energy , which the world using , comparing them . i found that all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes of maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 vastly better be going to the approaches to the time .
that 's not impossible , but it 's not that .
that happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources , we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of this is to earth .
if you to 100 percent of it up trying to , they need an with .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come to target ?
what we need are many companies , the work at it . hundreds of .
in every one of five different areas we need at least 100 people .
in many you will say , are crazy ! that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's many , there 's been engaged .
bill that has multiple different companies , under one of a glycoprotein called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold talks , and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear -- the way of descent .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; very repetitive , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas lying .

this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually had you about , long time thinking , but you could never can simulate , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputers -- there , you 're modeling and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it 's like that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , the garbage , and you can even the waste of any kind of them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , you simply burn it . one thing .
the low-enriched uranium dioxide is too uses , like a candle that .
you see that 's a bar is , often than `` a traveling wave of the reactor '' by the .
that solve really the <unk> .
this is a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , 99 percent . this , the of this that today , burn it 's going to <unk> so it <unk> uranium .

and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's a sample of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we do our success is , should .
how to our own testimony to look ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's actually very important that we go into .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , we have to clean .


that 's important .
this is a shift : this <unk> .
if we from there back , how to the 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the way to earth . the less we <unk> , more and one are going to the <unk> , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we have businesses , not completely to the big , <unk> lead , just right , in fact that matter less as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs that we do with the floor and further and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the all about the air . ''
they go it really , and create a frame , this broad range of can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very specific to accommodate that we this technology , one .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose which , lasts , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> without losing co2 is being invented . this desire to take , i .
this has the greatest impact .
if we 've got this desire to do n't get there to the dig in between the long and those business people feel terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
so how do we ?
for which means for <unk> i ?
we have to do for more the context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , they should not only about carbon .
they should those <unk> to go and they were shocked by the ridiculous have taken money , this using it approaches one is going .

we need to spread the message .
we need a conversation was and the entire lead and also the things that the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get to us an idea of the scale that investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation is on a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that it can work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is that build the first toolkit , another billion to find , the <unk> and the place the fact , of them .


bg : right . now you want to the reactor , to turn into it , so there 's many people and lots of control is that go wrong . this thing where you do it opens and things <unk> or going to get them . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years into it -- you think , a bar on -- the you have been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years , and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . now , with the garbage that happens : you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then they take him and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage by taking the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> at the reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so , this is , for these reactors operate a problem was that , what we 're in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people , this world over these ways we 've talked ,
where 's the interest , so what really to implement ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place a zoning and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's big interest and the people the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister , and talked about , like this to <unk> .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and the french and the japanese and have something in the direction .
this is a nuance of thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor was implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : the time frame and the probability that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that they 're very affordable , we have 20 years to make them , and then 20 years to use .
that is like the deadline , the <unk> to see this has , we all need to .
and , you know , <unk> , if anything good writing is , and that 's a desire , that easy .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of the same way , when their approaches to work , the funding for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the question , if it uses of creating , since then you could be a mixture .
, we need a solution .
what the large variety of major breakthroughs , this is the you know ?
bg : a <unk> like this is announcing .
that would it , without the <unk> been , but the power 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another very innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not so well , like this , but there 's the up way that 's a other way .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to , say that looked over us .
and there 's different , but the beauty in it is that a <unk> a million times as much energy , as a , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can get around and the are mainly the radiation , the footprint , and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost ran in your league schools .
if that does n't , what ?

bg : if you in this situation is , it 's as if you to a lot has eaten , and just a heart attack . , what do you ? you might be a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> called , with various techniques into the warming continues to delay , we 're going to 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't just to the insurance to work , because one that might be lazy , so you and eats , because you know that a the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if that smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem of eyes that , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that competition to have to , if the things faster come , this innovation , no longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have a or two sentences for the cell to you might want to convince them ?

the ones who , are doing , are very little bit .
they say that 's negative effects , there , with the clouds to have the things here ?
there 's very , very few things that you even say , of it 's a chance in a million there .
that <unk> here is like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compiled all problems , in something to invest in that you only later , what has -- and there 's the investment is not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there 's people in the rich world , the ipcc look and say , okay , that 's no big , drama .
the fact is that uncertainty of us about to do .
but my dream is that , it , economic and i can do , and at the co2 was eliminated , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost like to think it did that , but i 'm going to it has to accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would your answer on the <unk> lomborg argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , suffer migraines that <unk> , what all of malaria and so that 's a stupid waste of resources , is , money to invest , while it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , what actually spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , you spend when they 're doing today -- and that 's not just dramatic .
it should be other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and here we can bring sensible people on , if you something , that 's not economic growth is , and trying to the to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it was because , you is very briefly a <unk> and funded the only still the curve . i think we should be more things to mitigate the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich to keep up .
i mean , each of us here , i could take five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even lomborg comes to think anybody .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research do n't even more than one ? ''
he 's still , because of its former stories , <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very rare group is , and so it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , i for them to think .
the research , it 's crazy , how little the support it will .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope to her wish that 's going . so much .
bg : thanks .
few years ago , here at ted , so , peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .

the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really though , because it people being very quickly work together .
and so i thought that this an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops and the world being done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something , this task , and down some insights in the nature of cooperation across the technologies and i want some of them to share with you .
usually on the most people , in the task to orient .
you talk about , you go to look like it will look , they squeak , to go ,


and finally , just before they have no time , you have to take somebody decodes the marshmallow and they put him gently into the top , just a step back and `` <unk> '' ! again , their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the weight of the marshmallow is causing the whole thing , how you and <unk> .
there 's a number of people , much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and the worst enemies are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also on the very much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and the best are totally fresh alumni of kindergarten .
and this is quite astounding .
like us , peter ward was to make you 're not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?

they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one more reason .
and that that mba students get trained to have to see a real original plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow the top of profanity , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?

constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of <unk> are about .
and with every attempt to get the kids right across the feedback , what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how other teams to operate .

who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , .

and why ? because they are triangles began to understand and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to make stable structures to build .
the ceos are something about the average . but here 's interesting .
of you a will administrator at the team , you 're going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , to and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .

propagated across the skills and <unk> and the combination , leads to succeed .
if you 10 teams have the typical 're supposed to get you ca . six , stable structures .
i tried , well , very exciting .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered i a $ 10,000 dollars a price , software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high , which is built have , he have the price to home by .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a powerful cooling effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , for team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact , invest a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to multidisciplinary teams to help , cars , video and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is , they 're helping them , hidden collection of them to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the right prototype stage to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of them , it 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples of the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that structure actually a <unk> sports .
it demands that we all our senses , the task to feelings and that we think we can optimally use , how our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us , `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can a big difference .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past go , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here , and remain ,
and i wonder , what you would , because i my friends in a lot lately that question put to have , and they wanted everybody in the past .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time , before it , there or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm confident that you kind of nostalgia , and wishful thinking drawn is .
and that i understanding .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i was a explorers i 'm --
it 's because of options on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet , whatever , which the scale , which is : health , wealth , and mobility , but the declining <unk> .
it had ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died , when they had 60 were .
my grandparents , who were expecting that on 70 .
my parents are the one of the way down into iraq .
there should so eloquently than a nine o'clock at my <unk> .
but it 's not all time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi , born , it can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of the earth in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war , ever done .
they 're way . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . go pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have to do n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know all , anybody what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed , that are some successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , it change , if it does n't that does , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately is , the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often ,
and one of this is that despite all of our greatest achievements of a billion people in the world every day when to go down .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and more than that , we have our imagination used to , this world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , soon , and if we 're not because of chaos <unk> myself , we also .
so the question is , we can do that ? i think it is .
i think it 's recognized that we food can produce the billion people feed it , without the country , they live , to rape her .
i think , we can take this world with energy to that you do n't both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is holding me at night , wake up -- of the things amuse me at night awake . we 've been progress , it 's never really needed like now , never ,
and we were also still never in the opportunity to him about <unk> , we do it today .
we 're going to the threshold to see , astonishing design events on many places . and so , but i really , that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , i go back to have to a time to find , in the we progress , so there have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more found myself as now .
the people putting , in their faith , so closely , that you have n't release .
not , the truth will they free .
and you , everybody has a right on their opinion , ; even a right on their opinion , to ,
but you know , what they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their own . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it took the three out .
ago about a decade , i was a piece , vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to run into the resistance , because of what the end of the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do , i wrote a paper , on .

the same thing , only bigger .
the people who played out there .
so i also about one articles written , and i could n't understand why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain type of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were made me about , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and this is that these <unk> , me nuts were doing it does n't <unk> were .

they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so what i ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we 're honest .
we 're in one point where , in which we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how early .
we 're talking <unk> .
we talk to be ironic problem of , with a little quotes about : `` the progress . ''
okay , for it 's the reasons , and i think we know , which one is .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that it 's not be .
you can just a couple of the name call and the people will understand .

i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right have . be so they are skeptical .
imagine if you ask , for you have evidence , for you some evidence .
they take nothing more than any given to myself .
but now here 's : if you have evidence to get you want to this evidence to assume , and that we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , i they still never seen have and hopefully will never see again .
ago about 12 years was a story came out , a terrible story starts the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection to the government .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
lots of studies we should be done ; this is a serious .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the u.s. , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no significant correlation , no link , not .
it makes no difference . it makes no difference , because we , anecdotal , believe , we think , what we see , what we need to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we do n't think , a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i do that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was a little bit catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the one individual countries in the world , the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous outrage , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we could do .
well , i understand that i am .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a single mountain in the audience ever get to <unk> to see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths made by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we make this crowd out , and people like jenny mccarthy , can walk around and writing messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like watching oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things that does seem to be , but virtually never the same thing .
and it 's something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us by one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , not a very matter-of-factly , polio , go pfft , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> evolved .
he can the lives of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
now , that 's good , besides some of that paul and as well over the vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that the people just quit should be able to stay complaining .
and that says he actually so .
paul cézanne so this is a terrorist .
if paul charges in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without fully armed foot on one of behavior .
he gets calls home , because the people were able to be like to tell you know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul a vaccine against has done .
i do n't say that , but the vaccines are essential .
you take you continues to return to the disease , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be kids back about dying , because that 's just a question the numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about polio this ? we take that . why not ?

nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio do . not .
subtle .
why ? because we could n't see polio this . and you know what ?
we had in this country , no polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe she morning is anyone in lagos , a plane and i 'm going to just to go to los angeles , the moment he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours picking up he and <unk> a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is to visit .
and he does n't know that it with a stock disease , and there is , and we know that 's not , because that 's the world .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if it do n't think about .
we love it , we had in the lie to membrane . we love that .
they have the morning is all their supply vitamins had taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that they 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and you take an alternative to cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data will give the time .
they them up their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine .
i agree with them completely .
take their urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
well , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one to strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where we walk , we ?
we walk in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's fine . i love the <unk> .
but you know , actually this is a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of small , some here .
this does n't it -- <unk> , it was , <unk> , it was , <unk> , because i do n't know , what that is , but we give a billion dollars for , it 's -- was .
and you know what ? if i 'm not saying that , shouting at me the people , and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , do , what you want .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
it because i don’t care is , whether it 's the minister is , says , `` huh , i 'm going to the evidence of my research says , mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> them to .
if you on this way to , where i think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get you to a place , in which they do n't want to be .
they get to i mean in south africa .
he got there have its people to , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that you the course of aids , so you can .
hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you to tell me not that these things are no grave implications .
the have you . the you have always .

this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody 're , from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we 've all this .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of what does n't work .
now we can it more . and of course , there 's reckless risks . but we can do something like , vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i have to say , that i do n't .

why we do that ?
now , what i always listening is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we do n't want a huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies in the patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they 're right . fix that we can .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science is nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know the science does n't company .
you is no country .
you is n't an idea ; they 's a process .
you is a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but that we of science , not allow us to , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a really dead , and they 're holding millions of people from the great flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we 're going to 70 percent more than growing food to as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give it would n't tell you .

we want people do n't be empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has no one protein , and scientists to build all that they 're looking at a .
and then you might be the people that food and would n't think there are .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything that i say to it is : why are we have that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we have that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about the genes move . it 's not to throw chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our it be on the greater our food , better food , act at food .
it 's not about the rice <unk> , it 's about , the life to get , and it 's time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on doing as far do we 're going to a little bit guilty , in which we , i believe , not guilty , you want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other for that , what happened here .
it 's acting selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really stop .
after this amazing kind of entertainment and you want so we might say , you still in this ridiculous machine , and the future go ? ''
, sure . that i want , sure .
the moment is you in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can take this machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we they 're moving to , and we 're going to move , where we want .
we need to those conversations that lead , and we need to think , but if we 're in the machine , up and the future , we will be happy to be , that made .
i know that we do it , and as it me in this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i 've come for the <unk> . it might seem curious , that , a magician interested in that , it was because , you look at it like i , `` a deception , to a real space is , when someone just , enough that anybody believes . ''
other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , just so , because the person thinks , with her going to be a pharmaceutical companies , or a kind of -- in <unk> example , there 's , if the patient , we 're , enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , you the <unk> called .
one that you 're going to a real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'll show you , he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children .

i 'm going to him for you do and it and then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i call him , let me .
so , look what happens .
that knife , that they 're really can ; my hand , they do .
i 'm that knife . just like in my off .
i do you my sleeve , back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist on right here <unk> .
on this way , you can see that , to none of time , you move . as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics ago .
it 's actually so , to its place , it shake it , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> !
now , that 's a trick , i often a little kids affect , for magic that interest , because you can , very much about being able to learn , if you go closer look , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works like this :
i think that knife in my hand .
i say , my wrist <unk> , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> the , in that , the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment , which , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , so you back of see , moves , of hands on here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he 'd like this extended .
wonderful trick ?
back there 's got someone , not a childhood had .
so , it , this is here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why that a delusion is , why you do n't have facial , that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way he information of course , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but you as a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
of course it will be there would have no , but not by the fact , magnetics my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , that on the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement hidden behind the finger , again <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what has this with the <unk> to do ?
year ago , or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in a white or so we can offer , in the form of <unk> , is that just a round , white or so , one of measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> give them , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter that , cloaking them , it is actually a measurable more .
and that , no , or pharmaceutical industry ... it are just <unk> .
but a white or so that 's not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
it was , but that this is still not it 's .
if you capsules that takes , are still more than and every form .
a colored the capsule , in one end of the yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day 's not as well as three pills -- and i ca n't go into now , the statistics , remember . i 'm sorry , do .
the really , but is , ...
... that , the <unk> play a role .
and the shape who plays a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle that makes them .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very strong brand image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .

the fact , so this is that the white or so not so well , it looks like the blue pill , not so well , it looks like a cramped capsule that are not good , it looks like the needle .
and nothing of that has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , in us a greater impact on .
i want to know if i did this idea for a magic trick could use .
i suspect something that obviously a delusion is , and making it 's really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle to grab , if it on the thing to go to .
this is an 18 inch long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going , first a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin and bite , they keep them up , until you on the other side of the silky bubble .
if you it 's going -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , the , and some people , i did n't know , and it 's a woman who almost , he 'd become .

you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it goes like , right here , where my it starts , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a harvest .
i do , i really sorry . makes you go crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and the other so back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we do the <unk> .
it 's like .
but now , my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . that 's a , two , three times four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , just to us for a few minutes to talk . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
look like this from ? well .
, i know .
and the people back to say , `` okay . i did n't that 's seen . ''
the people in the <unk> come from now in .
you make it was to them from the near the time .
actually this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can that 's swivel around .
i 'm sorry , do . if you it 's going , look away , look not to myself .
the people back or the , that later , eventually , on video to see how to say , `` well , see that , yes , and pretty impressive , but if it 's really would , he would -- you see , here is a hole and there , if it really think it would , it to bleed . ''
okay , they will let me a little bit of blood for you <unk> .
yes , it is .
normally would i now the needle and pick out .
i would my arm safe and to show up to do n't wounds .
but i think , in this on here and with the intention , of being a real to do , i 'm going to the needle . just in there 's , and so from the stage .
we 're going to the next few days , a couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , already on . thanks .
everybody talks about today about happiness . .
i have some people at the number of books just let that , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years out , and they gave after about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest to happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier lives .
but despite all of tide of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to do , clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for layman to the over their own happiness is think , and it is for scientists , about happiness might think that , because it turns out that we just like this is what are like every other .
the first of the meeting is a <unk> , complexity of admit that .
it turns out , that the word , just not a useful in the word , is , because we do it on to all of how to work .
i think , there 's one of themselves , the we 's going to be , but in the great and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , that would have to have to what well-being is .
the second case is a people confuse of experience and memory , in basically consists of you between be happy in his life and be happy about to live or happy with his life .
and this are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's unfortunate the fact that we 're not about a circumstance that can think , the well-being of all , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example start from someone , a <unk> had , sort of my lectures , a story , which . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and , the end in this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience ever ruined .
but that i did n't .
what it was what was the memories , the experience .
he had the experience of out .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care about not , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was everything that he goes to keep getting had .
what we actually says , is that we about us and over the other people think we could in terms of two types of themselves .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present to live and the presence today knows , is able to the past back to experience , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives to maintain one , and it 's our highest-stakes gamble , that the doctor 's been by it 's the question is : `` how we have you it lately that feel ? ''
or `` how was their journey , albania ? '' or a similar .
this are two very different entities that <unk> , and that <unk> itself , and the wonderful to confuse this is part of the <unk> of exploring the lucky .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really begin with a basic reaction on our memories , -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not only tell stories , when we think that make the stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences , keep to 's a story .
and let you <unk> with an example .
there 's an old study .
that are real patients , a painful procedure in .
i 'm going to not get into detail . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , as this study in the 1990s , did was .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking : `` who of these people has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
a b , clearly , suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise ,
and the surprise is that patient is a in a lot <unk> <unk> , <unk> had as a b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very one big part of the story is , ending note --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain , the end on its peak . it 's a bad history .
how do we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> 've ever wondered , and as much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as to b in the <unk> .
now , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> , and the <unk> itself .
of the <unk> even had to b , clearly a <unk> time .
now , what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend by showing you just the hose in it 's no , very likely to him to shake up .
that 's going to the patient is suffering , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long does , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a worse off is , and this , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , your patient is a in a story about his experience , there .
but what 's being a story from ?
and this is for the stories that memory that provides and it 's also for the stories we invent .
but what 's a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> itself alive to live in continuously .
it has moments of <unk> , after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i do that 's about -- you know , the psychological present the other than about three seconds long . what i mean , you know that , in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , most of you do n't have a lane .
the most of you can be completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the impression that they are we assume that what during these moments of <unk> happens in our lives .
it 's the limited resource , we use as we 're in the world .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> even for us to keep .
so we do this <unk> , and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the interacting with time .
of the <unk> itself , if you a vacation . and the second one week , that 's good as the first , is the <unk> vacation at times as well as the <unk> vacation .
so that 's actually not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> 's hardly any more than the <unk> on , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on that 's time , the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little difference on this story .
so , that <unk> even make more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's our highest-stakes gamble , the making it , because if you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> , two different kinds of surgeons had , decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad news is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose not between those experiences . we choose between the memories , experiences .
and even if we 're going to the future thinking , we think , our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
and , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and you , that <unk> even think more than one , that , that <unk> even <unk> through experience , that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the impression that if we need to the very often the case is , that we make a vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of <unk> itself .
and that 's a little bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is a the types of explanations for the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think back to a vacation trip , we have a few years ago in antarctica . 've done , at the best on was , i ever had , and i think quite often it relates to the tools that , how often , i other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory , these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever the folder , you have had to look at 600 of it , i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .
now , i like a little extremely , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories of have , but itself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we these are there ?
so i want you to talk about a thought experiment to think .

now , you were the same to vote ?
and if you a different to vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of ourselves and they got to think about how you this conflict to decide , and that 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories are thinking about if you one another answer .
why we the <unk> choose , we pick it is a problem , that , we do with a choice between the two types of themselves .
now the two types of ourselves into two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness , we can use , one per copy themselves .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy there are those moments in the <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments , is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions , measured it can be ?
and the way , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from happiness , the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about them , as happy one person who lives .
it 's a thrill of how happy or by the person is , if this person about their lives , it .
very different .
everybody , those terms n't really different is the study of the of happiness -- it up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , exploration of happiness -- long screwed have on that way .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> , and the average happiness the <unk> itself is the last few years , people 's been , and now , which you , the individual , to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , more than a people ask the been are about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
the last few years , we have so i started , about happiness . the two types of ourselves to learn .
and the main one lesson that we , i believe we 've learned is that they really different .
you know , as being someone with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about how to be happy , he would be living her life and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to the correlation and it 's about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size , you know ?
now , it would do something about its size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell them that somebody would be life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about how to be happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what that does the <unk> .
we know that money , it 's the goals are very important .
we know that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there 's other occupational pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of ourselves to maximize that we want you going on the end very different things to do .
the implication of the oven , what i 'm here said , to have is that we 're lucky enough , not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , a another reason , of that we 're not clear about happiness can think is that we 're not the same things into that if we talk about the life thinking , and if we actually life .
so if you the easy to ask yourself , as happy , and the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you ask this question you think that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , think of the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that decides to be happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful , which is responsible , you get to the end -- some people might the end , california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people that , california , pull in the hope , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think is that they have are , because if you think about you will of it will , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel you to the right decision met .
it 's very hard , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope i have them a sense of that , how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question you .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks ago , on 've mentioned before they told me to that 's a pretty interesting result , that from this <unk> poll was .
this is something , what you to participate , let me , because they now a few minutes left would have ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most the thing that we have the <unk> survey found have is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in terms of happiness . the <unk> itself .
if we looked at the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out , that under a minimum income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a great representative sample , under a minimum income of 600,000 dollars ,
60,000 years .
dk : look .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people getting unhappy , and they are increasingly less and the poorer , they 're going .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that the money , no <unk> you , but that lack of money , certainly do you , and we can make this children , very , right rate .
in the other , the <unk> itself , you get another story .
ever more money you deserve more and helped me is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american now , it 's about the life , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that makes them seriously , we would take , i mean , it all the head to ask , everything that we think , for instance , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance to politicians that the country , generally a complementary finding out how to take seriously , would and based on that politics , would make us ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's credit , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does it 's you just and in other countries that happens , they 're now .
the people are doing that , recognizing that , they 're lucky to think should , if you , politics , thinking .
it will be a while , and the people will discuss them , if you <unk> explore , or whether they <unk> explore want , so we have to this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you know , that <unk> even think , or whether they have to look at the <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population , to measure .
this is , i think in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at least the most important political debate to set up to be about the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm watching jane mcgonigal , i make games .
i think now for the last 10 years , online . and my goal for the next decade is , it was as easy to make the world in the reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play more and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a lot of time for games . ''
maybe something to kind of time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i am convinced that , if we have the next century on this planet to want , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
that appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it , are we ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe we have to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of -- quite right , why i believe that play , so critical for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a her the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so , he of the players have a camera put up .
this is one of the classic affinity groups of the play .
if you do n't want gamers are , we think , you might be some of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , something , but also imagine your concentration , one in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouth that are a sign of teenage optimism . the eyebrows down to surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called distilled victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some outstanding players .
a <unk> the force is a result , that goes extremely positive is that they 'd do n't even knew that is it was possible .
it was almost smoke , beyond the imagination .
and if you it , they 're shocked me , and they actually going to something like this can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this one is a moment ago , distilled the victory .
and this is it , what we 're on millions of their faces of <unk> around the world look like to say , if we have the next century , it in taking . the face of those , as well , all odds on the edge of distilled victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we really difficult problems with .
i call it as the `` in life i a bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , like , `` in life i a bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former ombudsman at home in berkeley , california , where i in my ph.d. studying , why we in games are better than in real life .
that 's a problem , that many football players .
we think is that we have the reality is not that are good as in games .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the connection with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we were in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in our best possible version into , anytime and immediately helpful to 're going to have been to solve this problem to try and so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in the reality , if we fail , if we 're going on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated correctly . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games , there 's just they do n't .
and that 's what i was a student to look at .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't simply reach it all ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality that ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things that the epic counties that in <unk> so possible .
so , first , if you in one of online game going to all , the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are willing to you a <unk> mission <unk> , right .
but not just some of the mission , but a mission , perfectly to her current level of the game that well , right ?
so do this .
they have no one task , you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so , you want to work . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and about six months . it 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , engage with you to evaluate their epic journey were going to conclude .
that we have in real life , not that easy to this sense that at a <unk> of employees are willing to stand .
also , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have to be , `` level , '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did n't , plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that 's this is basit and is , anytime , the edge of distilled victory to stand out that we prefer our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's time in context to see , ago <unk> million years , began our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright became good primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now , to spend , does that just a sense , when you , the time in the scale of human development of eyes , holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out , that we , by we all of this time to play using the fact that change , what we as people in the able to .
we 're going to us to all business , very much beings .
that 's the truth . that i think .
at once they this thing about statistics , the recent graduating from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , you in the school to spend , of the fifth . grade to the end by the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have here , a complete <unk> , young people just learning , what it , a good poker player , like anything other , in the school .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .

we are so good at , what that to the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people that <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are are really good ? ''
because if we could figure that out , we have of that i 've never been there <unk> human potential to .
so many people have we currently in the world , as an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinarily well , `` something '' .
and the next decade we have another one billion players that are extraordinarily well , what that are .
if you do it 's still not have heard ,
the industry that <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online games .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to go to look what it is , at us these games to anybody coming .
here are the four things that i found . first , : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .

players to think always remember that a <unk> the force is possible , and that it , you think , it to try , right .
are not sit around .
are masters of spiders a social nets .
there 's a lot more research , to show that we are more like , after we with you 've been playing , even if you to the ills of the defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we trust is that somebody time with us to spend the rules <unk> be that we did the goal , and to the end of it .
so the technologies that we see that grow from that we 're going to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build greater understanding social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually have the hard to work , as if we wanted to relax , or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings that can work , if we were hard , where they work done .
and are always ready , hard to work , right to get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> got to be .
here 's a <unk> the the right light to back . you know . we all of wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft , the web and i 've seen as about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single result . are <unk> , hopeful way of individuals .
it are people , believe that you as individual can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the issue that i 'm going to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is awesome . he studied well , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to the idea of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that from an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that you odd fact , in the sense player can in <unk> more , as in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . they get more valuable feedback and those rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it is entirely obvious that are more time in the virtual world as in the real time .
i agree that first time to that 's logical .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game to turn into .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years , maybe further .
and there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
of these fantastic sketch it was <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story about , and why games have invented .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> as a famine .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine in the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea , i decided that .
the people suffering . the people fought side .
it was one of the situation . you need a page of the solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day you would play .
and they were as much in the <unk> one , there play , so we are and us , as , <unk> productivity with you to remember that would be that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> they survive , so for 18 years that famine , by , a day he ate ravenously and the next was playing .
as well , i think , we now play a .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world of the day .
we put play a cell to all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life , basit and is , and we bring us what we need of the play .
but that does n't been the current .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was , 18 years , the famine is not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they did the kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner boxes on to a distilled , it .
they were <unk> and now , the quest for a new home . they were just so many people , how it food to survive there and looking to the rest for an area , in the they are able to .
this sounds crazy , ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later that was that -- got up , the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so , and scientists recently , attitude to <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of global cooling , almost 20 years of it , famine , you could .
so i could take these crazy story of voices .
you might have actually their people through play rescued by looking to do for 18 years in games , escaped and , and then this as far , and so much about that playing with each learned that they provided by the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we 're playing , since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
so what i , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization depended on the quest for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .

i know , they 're going to ask : `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and that particular question i made some of the last few years , at the center for the future is devoted to .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it on them out how we the future , to be .
we do n't want to mitigate the future that to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people that powerful , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic counties ago , and give people the ways that you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly , three games that i designed to have to try to people that epic counties in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for them , it 's and you very real life in fact , without oil life . so , if you to play and register , they tell us , where you live . and then get you <unk> in real , to show you how much oil costs , what 's not there , because food , those is going to transport those are going to school closed are , whether it , that there . and to figure out how you her real life make , if it 's true if it . and we ask you , about to blog , and videos or the photos , to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the past three years , too .
and i can tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you , distilled adventures are and told you get , `` of us about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you about .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of gamers have the game <unk> habits that .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at target , you 'd rather than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
starting point is that calculation of <unk> that the people just , 23 years on the planet , and there .
this massive supercomputer called `` global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the call to players , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed accordingly .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> , and they can save the world .
but in our ladders game , instead of the only five million people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 player up playing the game 's eight weeks for .
they found in incredibly creative solutions that they read , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring the three . march . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
you look at the end , get you off the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> '' the end by 2010 .

we have a comic . we have `` level , '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite men , this game with young people to share , the world , all , in <unk> , of benefits , put together in their own social enterprises that had to save the world .
i am now to end .
i want you ask .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us , we can do , but we have to the real world still not be saved .
well , i hope you to me in that i agree that are human resources are , we need to work in real life can use , and games to be a big meaning for change .
we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social them to knit , <unk> and the craving for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we put together in history play games to knock on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me a few months ago , writing one article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write , my <unk> our questions , but i was playing with the kind of <unk> already done , and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have to the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , and exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and had to find laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just collecting , this <unk> <unk> and the so <unk> emotional shock .
of course , that was a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the copy , quite be old .
but actually it was a copy the early '80s , when i just with the school actually started and so began to my self outside of the family with her to build and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god is very thankful i was no <unk> .
i saw this post take seriously , i would have in a world was born , somebody like me as a person that would , whose lives in <unk> way that uplift it makes it . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated directly and expecting that i do this is a <unk> 'll find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
particularly great shock to me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not only to the words .
it 's what we 're going to the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it is the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values them .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to see around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greeks , and the roman , have really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that 's what you to <unk> , , <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a those people or a powerful people ?
just been a people <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you very modern-sounding ideas <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , for me to the has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , like , you think , the most americans are not accurate about it could . so he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , fly and was for the work with kids as simple .
i found the time , i in this hospital , i 'd have , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had one that will be forever , again with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> build . and i have this on down more being vilified as everything else . i did they hated it . i they felt crucified . i 've they hated it .
and , imagine i actually , as <unk> kid with dr. p. diddy vows to negotiate and that 's trying to these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , he told me , of my favorite exercises at -- this exercise it was really tiring and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going to one day of on whatsoever .
and if it till you , let me give you a hundred dollars . ''
of course that was just a lot easier to trick of dr. p. , so i the exercise will do that i do n't want to the prospect of the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the second third floor . but he has made me in fact that brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes . they are so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self being formed , and i 'm so imagine being able to me as a kind of the strong , powerful and <unk> person .
that 's just a sample of you , like adults in <unk> the comprehension of a child the work .
but how the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to figure out what we all want to count , it every single entry to themselves , as powerful people .
our language is behind the social changes as no , in many cases , through a technology changes it .
the medical contribution from , you can kind of course , say that my legs , <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and in something that <unk> , ranging from body , it allow people , really all their opportunities to use , little bit about the borders , you your natural , which he 'd actually has to figure out to develop , not going to speak of social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity , there , on its own way , and the way that , and , with the world , who believe that , pick .
maybe that 's so this technological change and clear , because i ever seen that it 's always been one other inconvenient truth , which is that every man of society , something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt yourself -- this is an interesting story , because people to me , that you ask them to how i do with the odds , i deal , and i 'm going to something to say , that sentence , for me never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
that sentence by interacting with tremendous odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness . it depends on , a challenge to anybody coming , without the to experience of a designer . as if my life so successful that would , because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic limb of it could , like that people to me with my disability as well .
but the truth is , we change . course , we 're talking about the challenge of a designer , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two days .
and i would argue that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> to be able to collaborate with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to be adversities , when my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind is , sometimes it 's not likely to see , but he 's constantly struggled with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact , or obstruction . the heavy filming the <unk> of people to be degrading .
there 's in your odds , and challenges , that are just <unk> real and each person 's so slightly differently . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds are coming , or not , but how we 're going to be clear to come .
so we 're not just for granted , the people would we love , ago <unk> to , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we need to be our kids do n't have fallen , if we do you feeling that there 's going to do n't want to the way .
you have to two things that dividing , one thing , the medical fact , an to be , and to the social think about , if i as i 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and you 're going to be disabled , i just sit down to is that the world and says , you can take me with these other definitions of .
in our desire , the people to protect , the heart of them and the cold , hard to the truth about their medical prediction , to communicate or even a forecast the quality to imagine that they expected , so we have to that we 're not the that started to put that somebody actually be disabled .
maybe this is what we concept , the only to pay attention , in a broken , is , and how we do that to fix , for every single one more profound disability than the pathology labs .
if we have a people not worth distinguishing treat , and not all his evil forces and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a people , for our society , a value .
so we have to the <unk> look out and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most important , but is that , between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .

it 's me , maybe it 's more , to imagine that we gave , not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open , are , you to hug , and make it really seize to stick to also , a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel like through their presence not more than that had .
the year in a celebration , we spend 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my on something very true in the human nature of this out .
i would it 's so what , not the most of its kind of you survive , and also not the <unk> its way , but the , to change the question is adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .

so , again , change and these things are the greatest , the human emotion .
and maybe we know , first , from some timber , we pinched are , if we really have to be .
maybe this is that the sense of the odds , a perception of these eyes , a feeling for our own power .
we can be so even something like to give you .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to the heavy time goes out .
maybe we gave , when you see the change .
odds are for a change , , we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the damage , we even in danger have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
well , honest , who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , this person who really know , learn to , if you really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different kind of the opportunity or the strength to it even still a little bit dangerous to me restate that they could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and they tend to invite men , very particular , and those skills in the society in .
<unk> have it 's found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed that have , to be and a contribution to do .
there 's cues to have the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries related to have worn away , and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for the society value was :
they have these people not as a broken and useless , at citarella ; they were regarded as something special , and really began to treat .
a few years ago i went around the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> from .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i am , as a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> . ''
and i turn to me , and see this whether her husband . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , one , barely able to me remind .
when i they first time , i saw , i do you from the belly of her mother was getting . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was , dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , very typical california , to my birthday , two weeks to be late husband came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mom was in on , and so , we knew my parents of the man , the me to the world . and , all .
and because i without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them pointing , and i just a couple of the toes , this and a couple of the toes into the other foot , he was the <unk> , this mail strangers to the bad news that your book .

really exceptional , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood , except now , whatever , if i held in <unk> in the second grade , won had , if i do with the <unk> at the mermaid parade , <unk> on was , whatever , if i my transplant fellowship , or of my <unk> counties <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x amount of the potential of human , willing .
you can just not enough to emphasize , how critical of a factor for the quality of people can be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and as someone to deal , two different things .
and also i quit my thinking over the changed over time , if you me the age of 15 years , they were saying , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone and switched to have , i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to look at once have normal work .
if you me that today to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , i have and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that 's also happen , because i was so many people in a while i 'm going to the me to the open , you have , instead of people to go , i do or me an idea on wanted .
and you see it really , people , you demos , their powers . <unk> , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone in the its own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do this , and for anyone in a critical moment a door busts open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means to bring that i 'm in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , what the potential to think we , it ?
in the '60s years has been reported in a <unk> done . at that were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` what they 're <unk> '' in the we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students going to music is it .
and the the a student will <unk> harder to have to get the better teacher , so forth .
they have then over a <unk> period of students , `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very good '' there . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a the heart to hear that way around the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only one of us who are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school , throwing .
thanks very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed .
you 've been just told that are the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and they 're treated .
the only really profound disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope that anymore . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity to the imagination .
if we do it , but to create the human spirit , to support to continue to hope for themselves , and other people to , around . if you find , and <unk> to be then put that we do really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities that , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want with a poem end , that , from persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written , and the me my friend , frere jacques <unk> told . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words , there and these are repeated , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thanks .
